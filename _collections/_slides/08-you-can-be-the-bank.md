  <p><b>Explain how DeFi passes the gatekeeping to allow users to hold roles that were traditionally restricted to banks. Discuss how a third party institution can create the trust needed to complete financial transactions, the tradeoff being the extra expense taken by banks for their services.</b></p>
  <p>A huge motivation that led to the creation of both Bitcoin and later DeFi has been the desire to circumvent unfair gatekeeping institutions, in this case, banks.</p>
  <p>DeFi allows for types of transactions that traditionally needed a bank to be conducted. There are a variety of reasons that these institutions were given this almost exclusive privilege. One is the liability that these banks undertake when allowing unverified actors to use their services. AML/KYC laws state that banks must verify the identity of those using their services, otherwise they are liable.</p>
  <p>Another main reason for banks controlling these services is because they were a third party institution that had the required capital. They provided value in the form of establishing trust between two other parties wanting to conduct a transaction. The economic principle of trust is simple. The less trust, the more people or institutions that have to be brought into the transaction, raising the cost for the original two parties.</p>
  <p>Banks have almost had a monopoly on being these trustworthy institutions. They also had the capital to provide banking services. Now decentralized networks have proven to be viable, especially at establishing trust through a protocol, or a set of rules that govern a network.</p>
  <p>The creation of Bitcoin allowed two strangers to conduct a transaction without the need for any entity to come in, facilitate the transaction, and take a cut of the asset or money being transferred. If banks are not needed to establish trust, and individuals have the capital that allows them to conduct transactions that were previously restricted to investment institutions, then why are banks needed?</p
  <p>This is the idea behind DeFi. Users trust a protocol and can then offer loans and other financial instruments. Trust is secured through established rules that are transparent to everybody. The technology to circumvent banks exists and is gaining rapidly, in terms of applications, money, and users.</p>
