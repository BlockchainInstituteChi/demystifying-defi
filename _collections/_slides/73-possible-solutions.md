  <p class="subtitle">What would a world with a strong DeFi ecosystem look like? What are the potential solutions to some of these problems?</p>
  <p>We have all of these issues acting as hurdles that are currently impeding the mass adoption of decentralization finance. The good news? A lot of these problems are going to be solved in due time.</p>
  <p>dApps will get easier to use as the ecosystem develops. As more people become aware of decentralized finance as an option, these dApps will gain more users. Once that happens, more liquidity will be added to the DeFi ecosystem.</p>
  <p>The privacy issue is being tackled by multiple teams and is second only to the scaling problem. While we addressed the overall scaling issue in the prerequisite Crypto Curious Course, we mainly focused on scaling solutions geared towards Bitcoin. There are several projects researching different strategies regarding scaling as ethereum transitions to Eth 2.0.</p>
  <p>One of the most promising solutions for ethereum payment scaling is the Plasma network. The Plasma network has the same goal as Bitcoin's Lightning Network. Plasma is a second layer solution that can create "child chains" that do not have to constantly synchronize with the main chain, relieving the chance for backlog since certain transactions are done off-chain. This technology is being paired with a solution known as rollups, which can help maintain a valid consensus while maintaining synchronicity between the main chain and child chains.</p>
