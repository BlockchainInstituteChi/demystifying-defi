  <p class="subtitle">Examine the relationship between stablecoins and markets to explain how they maintain a consistent value.</p>

  <p>Stablecoins offer the opportunity for more traditional financial markets to arise surrounding cryptocurrencies. Additionally, a stablecoin may provide investors the confidence they need to get involved with cryptocurrencies, as stablecoins act as an easy way to preserve the value of your crypto by avoiding volatility. Users of the stablecoin will not be impacted by volatility and it allows for easy conversion from the stablecoin to another cryptocurrency. If desired, each user can customize how much of their cryptocurrency they want to be subject to volatility or be assured of stability, essentially giving the user control over their own cryptocurrency investments. Stablecoins are all designed to hold a consistent price, however, different stablecoins have found different ways of achieving this goal.</p>
