    <p class="subtitle">There are certain questions about blockchain technology that are yet to be answered.</p>
    <p>There are some questions involving blockchain technology that are yet to be resolved. Managing and making decisions about the governance of a decentralized network is much harder compared to a centralized system. Blockchains are not a perfect technology. There is the possibility that something can go wrong. So what decisions are made and who makes them?</p>
    <p>Blockchain technology offers many potential solutions, but at which rate should it be adopted?</p>
    <p>Historical data is part of the blockchain&apos;s digital architecture, but at what point does certain data become irrelevant? You don&apos;t need to know about the production of a certain food once it has been safely consumed; the data is simply bloating the chain, slowing things down. How do you manage historical data that might not be that important?</p>
