  <p><b>Some financial apps need a certain amount of money in the market to make them functional. While the DeFi system is growing and the larger dapps have sufficient market liquidity, this can be an obstacle for newer dApps that depend on market economics. Examine possible solutions.</b></p>
  <p>There has to be the necessary amount of capital for a market to form. Without this, the amount of financial instruments that can be used are greatly limited. Markets that lack liquidity can also be prone to volatility. It has become clear that decentralized finance apps need a certain amount of money in the market to make the ecosystem functional.</p>
  <p>While the DeFi system is growing and the larger dapps have market liquidity, this can be an obstacle for newer dApps that depend on market economics. This has not completely prevented protocols from gaining rapid user growth, but it certainly impacts the functionality and usability of a dApp. However, we are already seeing solutions to this problem. When DeFi was new, this was a major issue. Now that the ecosystem has drawn a significant amount of capital, allowing multiple dApps to function within DeFi, this is less of an issue. Tools like Uniswap connect liquidity providers from across the world using decentralized protocols. As of authorship of this course, the DeFi ecosystem has $13.8 Billion USD locked into it.</p>
