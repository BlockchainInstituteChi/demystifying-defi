  <p>A major part of what caused those projects to go under was their inability to diversify from cryptocurrency, which was a particularly volatile asset at this point. </p>
    
  <p>Cryptocurrency prices experienced wild swings during this time. It was routine to see the market swing 20% either way. Many companies kept their holdings as volatile cryptocurrency, and when the ICO bubble popped, cryptocurrencies uniformly vastly decreased in value.</p>
    
  <p>The advent of a different type of cryptocurrency looked to solve this problem. Instead of creating a speculative asset with a fluctuating price, this new digital currency was designed to hold a specific value, usually one USD. This allowed projects the confidence that their funding would not vastly decrease overnight. The same confidence was extended to merchants who could protect against volatility.</p>
    
  <p>Additionally, it was not always easy to turn crypto to fiat and back again. Stablecoins acted as a compromise, a middle state that allowed people to easily enter and exit the volatile crypto market.</p>
