    <p class="subtitle">Unlike a physical wallet, your funds can be restored if there is a problem with your cryptocurrency wallet.</p>
    <p>One of the best features of cryptocurrency wallets compared to their physical counterparts is that if you lose your wallet in the real world, your funds are completely lost. This is not true for cryptocurrency. Remember, your crypto is not actually stored in your wallet, rather the wallet acts as a reference to the blockchain that allows you to manage your crypto using your keys. This means that losing a cryptocurrency wallet is not a big deal as long as you have your private key or seed phrase. Simply get a new wallet, use your private key or seed phrase, and you have restored your cryptocurrency into your new wallet.</p>
