  <p class="subtitle">What is decentralized asset management? Examine tokenized assets using ERC-721 and their impact on asset management.</p>
  <p>One of the innovations that shaped decentralized asset management was the introduction of ERC-721 tokens. As previously mentioned, these are non-fungible tokens that represent physical assets or digital collectibles that are not split or divided, such as the deed to a home. The dApp that showed that this concept could work was the aforementioned cryptokitties. Although these digital kitties did not represent actual real world assets, they helped prove that individual assets could be represented via a token. The market for cryptokitties exploded, with many being bought and sold every hour.</p>
  <p>If digital assets can be represented on the blockchain, then why not represent real world assets via a token? Some projects are already working on digitizing assets using non fungible-tokens, opening up all kinds of new markets and uses.</p>
