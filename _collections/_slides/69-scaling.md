  <p class="subtitle">Explain the scaling problem. DeFi dApps need the base layer they are built upon to find success, otherwise DeFi will have trouble catching up. There are a variety of possible scaling solutions that are being explored, like second layer networks and sharding.</p>
  <p>This issue is not new. We mentioned that the ethereum network has experienced backlogs, delays, and high fees (as mentioned earlier with Cryptokitties). There are multiple projects looking to solve this problem, and they have been working in a variety of ways to address the limitations of the network. The inability to scale must be addressed for DeFi dapps to grow, but the next generation of ethereum developers are well on their way to achieving this goal.</p>
  <p>As mentioned, a variety of solutions are being explored. This includes ways to improve the efficiency of payment processing or how smart contracts function. Many have to do with adding a "second layer" to the network that allows for the quicker processing of transactions.</p>
  <p>Additionally, the ethereum network is undergoing a gradual transition towards what is being called Eth 2.0, which includes a move to proof-of-stake mining that when combined with a viable second layer solution could make the way nodes reach consensus more efficient. Vitalik Buterin claims that a shift to Eth 2.0 will increase transaction throughput, scaling up from 2000 to 3000tx/second in the first couple of years to 100k tx/s once the ethereum 2.0 protocol is fully installed.</p>
