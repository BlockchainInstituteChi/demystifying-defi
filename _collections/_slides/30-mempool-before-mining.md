    <p class="subtitle">The mempool is where valid, but unconfirmed transactions are stored before they are mined.</p>
    <p>The &#x201C;place&#x201D; that holds pending transactions that have been initiated but not included into a block is called the mempool. </p>
    <p>Essentially the mempool is a waiting room. Transactions have not yet been validated, nor has it been invalidated. These transactions just wait for their turn to be included into a block. </p>
