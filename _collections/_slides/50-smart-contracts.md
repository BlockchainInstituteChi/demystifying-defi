    <p class="subtitle">Smart contracts are on-chain programs that can execute transactions autonomously based on programmed conditions.</p>
    <p>Smart contracts are protocols that allow action autonomously without the need for third parties. These programs reside on-chain and are able to process data in a decentralized manner. A series of smart contracts can be utilized to create a decentralized application or dApp for short. Instead of a server processing requests, dApps use decentralized consensus in order to process data transfers.</p>
    <p>There are some core components of a contract, but others can be added to the code as well:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Time or duration</li>
        <li>Amount to be transferred</li>
        <li>Set of specific conditions or a triggering mechanism</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Smart contracts are an abstract process, but their best real world analogy is a vending machine. A vending machine has assets it controls. All the user has to do is input money and set directions. The vending machine responds accordingly. The same is true for a smart contract. By sending a contract funds and a set of directions, a corresponding action is executed by the smart contract.</p>
