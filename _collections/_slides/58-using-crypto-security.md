  <p class="subtitle">While DeFi is adapting many tradtional financial concepts, the centralized finance space has the opportunity to utilize security features of a decentralized networks and cryptography. Crypto security features can be introduced via decentralized applications and then adapted to the tradiotional financial system.</p>
  <p>We have talked about traditional financial instruments coming to cryptocurrency, but the crypto-finance relationship might prove to be a two-way road. There are new technological advancements that are being brought to the traditional financial industry, specifically the security aspects built into the blockchain.</p>
  <p>Traditionally, we have had to rely on centralized institutions to store our money and perform any financial services. Throughout history, individuals didn't really have full control over their own finances; they had to use these third parties to manage their money. This is no longer the case. Cryptocurrency has built in features that allow for you to have sole ownership of your coins. As we discussed in a previous course, if you, and only you, have your private key, you have sole control over your cryptocurrency. If you want to seek a loan, some might choose to utilize DeFi in order to provide the financial services provided by centralized institutions.</p>
   <p>Cryptocurrency gives people unprecedented control over their assets. The potential for these blockchain based technologies to affect traditional finance is great, especially when it comes to cryptographic-based security.</p>
