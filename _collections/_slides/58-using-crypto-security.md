  <p><b>While DeFi is adapting many tradtional financial concepts, the centralized finance space has the opportunity to utilize security features of a decentralized network. Crypto security features can be applied to a financial system by way of DeFi.</b></p>
  <p>We have talked about traditional financial instruments coming to cryptocurrency, but that is actually a two-way road. There are new technological advancements that are being brought to the traditional financial industry, specifically the security aspects built into the blockchain.</p>
  <p>Traditionally, we have had to rely on centralized institutions to store our money and perform any financial services. Throughout history, individuals didn't really have full control over their own finances; they had to use these third parties to manage their money. This is no longer the case. Cryptocurrency has built in features that allow for sole ownership of your coins. As we discussed in a previous course, if you, and only you, have your private key, you have sole control over your cryptocurrency. If you want to seek a loan, there is no need to use a traditional financial service if there is a robust decentralized option available.</p>
   <p>Cryptocurrency gives people unprecedented control over their assets. The potential for these blockchain based technologies to affect traditional finance is great , especially when it comes to security.</p>
