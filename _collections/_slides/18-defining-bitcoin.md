    <p class="subtitle">Define and compare Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, and blockchain.</p>
    <p>You learned about the formation of the Bitcoin network, and why it is useful. Time to explore the more technical definitions of Bitcoin.</p>
    <p>Bitcoin is both the name of a cryptocurrency and its network. It was both the first cryptocurrency and blockchain.</p>
    <p>Now there is a small issue with this definition. By defining Bitcoin two new terms have been introduced and need to be defined.</p>
    <p>The first term that gets introduced in the definition of bitcoin is cryptocurrency, which is defined as digital currency that is created through a secure process that uses advanced math known as cryptography. Bitcoin is an example of a cryptocurrency.</p>
    <p>The second new term that was introduced in the definition of bitcoin is the term blockchain.</p>
    <p>A blockchain is the technological backbone that allows cryptocurrencies to function. The Bitcoin network is an example of blockchain technology in action. </p>
    <p>To summarize, bitcoin is a cryptocurrency transmitted on the Bitcoin network, utilizing blockchain technology.</p>
