notes: | 
    <p class="subtitle">Error 402 shows that the creators of the World Wide Web protocols had considered the concept of a digital currency.</p>
    <p>Has anyone ever heard of &#x201C;error 402&#x201D;? It&apos;s a more obscure protocol that has to do with insufficient payment submitted via the world wide web. What can we infer from this? Well, when these protocols were being written, their authors had an idea for an internet-based payment so they included an error for &#x201C;insufficient payment&#x201D;. This might have actually been the first time that anybody had ever approached the topic of a payment mechanism via the world wide web.</p>
    <p>This idea of a digital currency was explored in coming decades, which would ultimately lead to the creation of Bitcoin.</p>
