    <p class="subtitle">The United States housing and mortgage crisis that led to global economic turmoil was a catalyst that led to the creation of Bitcoin.</p>
    <p>What caused these banks to collapse? A large factor was a massively inflated housing market. The middle class had bought into the dream of homeownership, the result of a fairly consistent increase in housing values. For this reason, property was considered one of the best investments to make. </p>
    <p>This eventually created an unnatural demand, which resulted in cheap credit being offered to unqualified recipients. Traditionally, it was suggested that you place a down payment of 20% of the home&apos;s value when making that purchase. Instead of requiring this 20% down payment from borrowers, banks offered an additional loan to cover part of this down payment obligation. Instead of a 20% down payment, they only had to put up 5% to secure that extra 15%, simply for the down payment. Basically, they were getting an additional mortgage on the down payment, a practice that quickly proved unsustainable. </p>
    <p>These bad housing investments were placed into securities, which grouped different types of investments with these unsustainable ones. The problem was that if part of the security went bad, like housing investments, the rest of the investments within the security goes bad.</p>
    <p>This creates a domino effect of securities grouping together unrelated investments which made sure the house came tumbling down at the first sign of trouble. Investment banks began to fail, the stock market acted accordingly. Savings disappeared causing widespread panic. </p>
