  <p class="subtitle">Savings accounts in real life provide modest yields. How do savings accounts work? Banks get to use your money and you only receive a small interest rate for allowing them to do so. People had crypto just sitting in wallets. DeFi allows individuals to offer banking services, allowing a growth rate on crypto locked into a smart contract.</p>
  <p>In order to understand the relationship between savings accounts and bank loans, let's take a look at the existing centralized financial system. Besides investments, the main way that banks make their revenue is through loaning out their available capital. In order to maximize revenue, they have to have as much capital as possible to loan out. In order to attract capital, banks offer an extremely low rate on whatever money you allow them to hold and use via your savings account.</p>
  <p>That's right, that money doesn't stay locked in a vault. No, banks use that capital to make even more. They loan out your savings at rates such as 10%, while giving you just a fraction of that rate. Banks are very much facilitators or middlemen. Remember, DeFi is about cutting out the role of the banks. As a result, we're seeing users bypass the typical savings-loan model now that there is a system in place that allows them to directly loan out their own funds. By eliminating the banks via DeFi, users can charge a lower interest rate than what a bank normally charges, but higher than the minuscule amount that banks currently offer as savings.</p>
