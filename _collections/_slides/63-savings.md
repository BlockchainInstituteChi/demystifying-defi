  <p class="subtitle">Savings accounts have traditionally provided modest yields. How exactly do savings accounts work? Banks get to use your money and you only receive a small interest rate for allowing them to do so. People had crypto just sitting in wallets. DeFi allows individuals to offer banking services, allowing a growth rate on crypto locked into a smart contract.</p>
  <p>In order to understand the relationship between savings accounts and bank loans, let's take a look at the existing centralized financial system. Besides investments, the main way that banks make their revenue is through loaning out available capital. In order to maximize revenue, they have to have as much capital as possible to loan out. In order to attract capital, banks offer an extremely low interest rate on whatever money you allow them to hold and use via your savings account.</p>
  <p>That's right, your money doesn't stay locked in a vault. No, banks use that money to make even more. They loan out your savings at rates such as 10%, while giving you just a fraction of that rate. Banks are very much facilitators or middlemen. Remember, DeFi is about democratizing the role of the banks. As a result, we're seeing users bypass the typical savings-loan model now that there is a system in place that allows them to directly loan out their own funds. By circumventing the banks via DeFi, users can charge a lower interest rate than what a bank normally charges, but receive more than the minuscule amount that banks currently offer as incentive for savings.</p>
