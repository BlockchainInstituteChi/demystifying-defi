    <p class="subtitle">Some details on the blockchain are public while some information is obscured.</p>
    <p>Does anyone know of some information you wouldn&apos;t want stored on the blockchain?</p>
    <p>I wouldn&apos;t want my medical records stored on a public database.</p>
    <p>Remember, the data transacted is all public. This is fine for some purchases, but not all of your private data. There are specific blockchains that are hyperfocused on privacy, and those don&apos;t publicly display all of the details of a transaction the way bitcoin does.</p>
    <p>The privacy aspect of bitcoin has to do with the addresses that every crypto holder has. </p>
    <p>Every single person sending transactions via a blockchain has an address that is public to the entire network. This is the address someone would use if they wanted to send you cryptocurrency.</p>
    <p>Addresses are like a mailbox. Anyone can drop something in, only one person can take it out.</p>
    <p>Pseudonymous basically means partially anonymous. These addresses are long, jumbled strings of text, it has nothing to do with your name or identity. However, this doesn&apos;t make the network anonymous. Since everything is public, blockchain forensic experts have been able to trace bitcoin from address to address, ultimately identifying the group or individuals behind those addresses. It&apos;s not easy, but it certainly is not impossible.</p>
