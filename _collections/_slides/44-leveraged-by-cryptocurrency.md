  <p class="subtitle">Goal: Explain how collateralization of crypto can be used to create stablecoins</p>

  <p>Some stablecoins are actually backed by cryptocurrency itself. While this seems like an impossible prospect considering the volatility of cryptocurrency, projects have created ecosystems that have been able to maintain a relatively stable value. To ensure some stability, this type of stablecoin is usually backed by the more stable cryptocurrencies, mainly bitcoin and ether. To further ensure price stability, cryptocurrency backed stablecoins can be backed by more than one cryptocurrency; if you spread your backing assets among several cryptocurrencies, there is less chance of experiencing overall volatility compared to relying on one cryptocurrency to hold its value. However, cryptocurrency backed stablecoins are more likely to see fluctuation in price when compared to cash backed stablecoins. </p>

  <p>The solution is a practice called over-collateralization. Instead of a fiat backed stablecoin that is backed by a 1:1 token to cash reserve, crypto-backed stablecoins are often backed by a 1:>1 token to cryptocurrency reserve. Simply put, since cryptocurrency is more likely to fluctuate than fiat currency, the reserves have to amount to more than the value of tokens in circulation. With this method, price drops of the backing assets can occur without the stablecoin losing value. Since the backing asset is a cryptocurrency, not only is there transparency within the stablecoin contract, there is also a transparent blockchain that is recording the history of the backing cryptocurrencies. Transparency can be achieved without the help of a third party.</p>

  <p>MakerDAO is an Ethereum-based project that uses two volatile cryptocurrencies to stabilize a third.. Basically, MakerDAO uses ether and the Maker token in order to stabilize the price of a third cryptocurrency, DAI. Despite this somewhat complex ecosystem, DAI is supposed to remain around 1 USD. DAI has been battle-tested; the price of ether saw drastic drops in 2018, however, DAI maintained 93% of its value and quickly returned to 1 USD.</p>

  <p>“Maker’s DAI is a stablecoin that lives completely on the blockchain chain with its stability unmediated by the legal system or trusted counterparties.” -Gregory DiPrisco</p>
  
  <p>A key mechanism that allows DAI to maintain enough collateral to back its tokens is what is known as a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP). The amount of ether that has to be staked in order to create a DAI token is variable. Usually, it takes about 1.5 ether to create a dollar amount of DAI. For example, $150 worth of ether can be leveraged to create 100 DAI. If the price begins to fall, the amount of ether required to create DAI may be decreased in the hopes that more money will be injected into the Maker ecosystem. The Maker token is used to pay for fees on the network. It is not mineable and the token supply is managed in order to stabilize the price of DAI. This process is facilitated through a smart contract that creates collateralized debt positions.</p>

  <p>A traditional loan usually requires some type of collateral to be posted in return for borrowed cash. However, if the value of the posted collateral decreases, the lender may ask for the loan to be paid back, as the value of the collateral could no longer mitigate a default on the loan repayment. Basically, there are no assets to liquidate if the loan is not being repaid. If the collateral maintains value and the loan is not being repaid, the collateral could be liquidated. </p>

  <p>This is how the Maker ecosystem functions. You put ether into the Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) smart contract as collateral and receive a corresponding loan in DAI. If the value of ether goes up, there is no problem as the loan remains overcollateralized. If the value of ether goes below a certain point, you have to repay the loan. Otherwise the ether is sold off to pay back the loan. </p>

  <p>The amount of DAI created by the smart contract corresponds to the amount of ether sent. This ratio is fixed by the Maker network, but can be amended to stabilize the price of DAI if there is a significant fluctuation in ether’s price.</p>

  <p>For the sake of example, let’s say that ether is worth $100 and the collateralization ratio set by Maker is 150%. Sending 1 ether (valued at $100) will result in the smart contract creating 100 DAI. If I send 1 ether ($100) into the CDP smart contract, then I am now able to create 66 DAI. This means that, at the current value of ether, each 100 DAI that I’ve created is backed by 1.5 ether collateral. Once you pay back the DAI, you receive the ether originally sent to the contract. Your collateral is returned. Once this occurs, the DAI is burned, or digitally destroyed.</p>
