    <p class="subtitle">Introduce and explain advantages of paper wallets.</p>
    <p>Paper wallets are a piece of paper containing a public and private key, and often a QR code for each key. The public key acts as a means to deposit, while the private key is needed to spend, or withdraw, the funds. Paper wallets are the ultimate example of a cold wallet, as the funds are essentially taken off-line. The only way to access these funds is to restore them onto another wallet. </p>
    <p>This is the most secure way to store cryptocurrency. No one can get access to your cryptocurrency unless your private keys have been compromised. However, if you lose your paper wallet, those funds are lost as well, as the private key cannot be recovered.</p>
