    <p class="subtitle">In this section we will be exploring the mining process.</p>
    <p>It&apos;s one thing to know why bitcoin and decentralization are important, but it&apos;s a completely different thing to know what&apos;s going on under the hood. When you have a central server calling the shots, processing data is a lot easier. Simply send a request to a server and that server will execute a corresponding action. Of course, these central servers come with that data collection tradeoff. So how does a blockchain function, or come to decisions, if there isn&apos;t a central server calling all the shots? How do the computers on the network stay in agreement, how do they maintain a public ledger?</p>
