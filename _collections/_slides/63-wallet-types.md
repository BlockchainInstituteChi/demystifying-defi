    <p class="subtitle">TThere are many different cryptocurrency wallet options that offer different levels of security and useability.</p>
    <p>There are many different options when it comes to cryptocurrency wallets. Some are specific to certain tokens, but many have multi-token support, allowing you to keep many different cryptocurrencies in one place.</p>
    <p>There&apos;s a couple general classifications when it comes to crypto wallets. The first is what does the user intend to be the primary function of their wallet, and for different people there are going to be different answers.</p>
    <p>Some people want their cryptocurrency wallets to be part of their everyday spending. While these people obviously want their funds to be secure, they also don&apos;t want to have to jump through hoops every time they are conducting a crypto transaction. These individuals prefer hot wallets, which prioritize transactability, or the ease of conducting a transaction. Others simply want to use their wallet as secure storage for their crypto. These individuals tend to use cold wallets, where the main goal is to keep funds as secure as possible, even if it makes sending and receiving crypto slightly more difficult.</p>
