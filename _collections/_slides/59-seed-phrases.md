    <p class="subtitle">Seed phrases are a series of words that act as a simplified private key.</p>
    <p>This is a seed phrase. A seed phrase has the same exact function as a private key. In fact, it&apos;s just an easier to read representation of your private key. That&apos;s why if you&apos;re using a seed phrase it&apos;s important to take the same security precautions as you would with your private key. </p>
    <p>One reason that seed phrases are represented as a set of 12 or 24 simple words as opposed to a long string of text is that it is just easier to handle. When you download an application to hold your cryptocurrency, it will most likely provide you with a seed phrase, and you&apos;ll be instructed to write it down. Many wallet apps will then ask you to do a task to prove you have written it down. For example, after displaying your seed phrase the app may ask you to tell it which word was in what position. </p>
    <p>It is extremely important to keep your seed phrase safe, as it can be used to back-up and restore your cryptocurrency.</p>
