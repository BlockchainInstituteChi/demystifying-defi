  <p><b>Reexamine the motivations behind the creation of Bitcoin. While Bitcoin has fulfilled its stated purpose as peer-to-peer decentralized cash, developers asked if the Bitcoin blockchain could do more with the chain. Developers sought to create new features such as non-fungible tokens and decentralized finance applications.</b></p>
  <p>These entities could charge these fees for their inefficient services because there was no alternate option. They had essentially cornered the market and had no incentive to further innovate. These banks and money transmitters were making a lot of money and were happy with the status quo.</p>
  <p>That's why the introduction of Bitcoin was so interesting; it introduced competition into an industry that previously had no challengers. For the first time, banks weren't the obvious option to send money, especially across borders.</p>
  <p>People started to ask a question that would become very important: What if blockchain technology can do more than simply transfer cryptocurrency? What if a blockchain could process data, both financial and non-financial? What if we could build decentralized programs on a blockchain?</p>
