  <p><b>Examine the innovations that other blockchains have made. While Bitcoin had its inherent limitations, these projects attempted to address them.</b></p>
  <p>Despite Bitcoin's success, there were inherent limitations when it came to developing upon the Bitcoin blockchain. One of these limitations was the amount of data that could be held in a block along with the fact that Bitcoin aimed to confirm a batch of transactions just once every ten minutes. Smart contracts containing data and blocks are limited by how much data they can hold. Developing complex smart contracts on Bitcoin was made more difficult by lengthy confirmation times.</p>
  <p>The technological shortcomings that kept Bitcoin from advancing were noticed by several other projects. Many decided to create their own forms of currency or even their own blockchain in order to improve upon the established Bitcoin protocol.</p>
  <p>Some of these technological issues included supply availability, transaction times, the use of non-fungible tokens to represent real-world assets, and the creation of a blockchain designed to run decentralized applications.</p>
  <p>The years after Bitcoin launched saw rapid innovation. The standard for blockchains was set by Bitcoin. Now other projects were looking to iterate off of the decentralized peer-to-peer cash transfer system in order to apply blockchain technology to applications outside of simple money transfer.</p>
