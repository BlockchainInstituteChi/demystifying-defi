  <p class="subtitle">Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, gave any internet user the ability to transfer funds across borders. Bitcoin looked especially promising for certain locations that did not have mechanisms to transfer cash in a digital manner. This is also true for basic financial services that are usually provided by larger financial institutions with lots of capital. Access to banking is limited by geography, with specific areas lacking basic banking services. DeFi applications transcend borders; anyone with internet access can participate in this developing global financial system.</p>
  <p>One of the most unique aspects of decentralized finance is its inherent open and inclusive nature. DeFi builds upon established public blockchains. This means that anybody can join these communities/ecosystems, with all transactions able to be viewed in a transparent manner.</p>
  <p>For the average person in a more developed economy, the rise of DeFi might just be an interesting option outside of the current financial system. Gatekeeping financial institutions have created a closed system where only they are privy to any information exchanged. They use data that consumers do not have access to in order to help their own business positions.</p>
  <p>These banks also have control over who is able to use their services. This practice makes sense from a legal aspect, but there have been people that have been excluded from these closed financial systems. The existing global financial system's reason for this is simple; these institutions have not extended their services to certain geographic areas. The result is that a significant portion of the world doesn't have access to the financial services that others have the opportunity to use.</p>
  <p>DeFi turns this concept on its head. Most of the areas that have been financially neglected happen to be poorer countries. Less money flowing into the system means less interest for banks and investors. Blockchain technology and DeFi's open nature has led to a viable economic option for those that traditional financial institutions have neglected, through a variety of applications like crypto-backed microlaons.</p>
