  <p class="subtitle">Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, gave any internet user the ability to transfer funds across borders. This was a very big deal to certain areas that did not have mechanisms to transfer cash in a digital manner. This is also true for basic financial services that are usually provided by larger financial institutions. Access to banking is limited by geography, with specific areas lacking basic banking services. DeFi dApps transcend borders; anyone with internet access can participate in this global financial system.</p>
  <p>One of the most unique aspects of Decentralized finance is its inherent open and inclusive nature. DeFi builds upon established public blockchains. This means that anybody can join these communities/ecosystems.</p>
  <p>For the average person in a more developed economy, this might just be an interesting option outside of the current financial system. Gatekeeping financial institutions have created a closed system where only they are privy to any information exchanged. They use data that consumers do not have access to in order to help their own business positions.</p>
  <p>These banks also have disproportionate control over who can use their services. This practice makes sense from a legal aspect, but there have been people that have been excluded from these closed financial systems. Their reason for this is simple; these institutions have not extended their services to certain geographic areas, a side effect of profit seeking. The result is that a significant portion of the world doesn't have access to the financial services that others have the opportunity to participate in.</p>
  <p>DeFi turns this concept on its head. Most of the areas that have been financially neglected happen to be poorer countries. Less money to make means less interest from banks and investors. Blockchain technology and DeFi's open nature has led to a viable economic option for those that traditional financial institutions have neglected.</p>
