  <p><b>Introduce the concept of smart contracts beyond Bitcoin using a vending machine as a real-world example. Explain how smart contracts play into the blockchain ecosystem.</b></p>
  <p>Smart contracts are autonomous, self-executing programs that live on the blockchain. They can be programmed to conduct a specific action without human intervention as long as funding and instructions are provided. A network of smart contracts can be used to form a dApp, or decentralized application.<p>
  <p>The best real-world analogy to a smart contract would be a vending machine. Remember, smart contracts are able to execute a directed action if properly funded. This is the exact same situation as using a vending machine. After entering your money, you punch the corresponding number that will provide your desired snack. You are providing funding paired with a special set of instructions and the vending machine functions autonomously. Nobody has to be there to dispense your snack. The machine can do it on its own.</p>
  <p>These traits are shared by smart contracts. Smart contracts are decentralized programs that are given a specific function that they can carry out themselves if the required funding and directions are provided. Smart contracts are autonomous and self-executing; they do not need human intervention to function. Instead of trusting a third party to provide a service that is needed, the protocol can be trusted. Establishing trust with code is a lot easier, and more cost-efficient than trusting a third party. This is even more true if the smart contract's code is transparent, as it is on the blockchain. It is auditable by anyone.</p>
