    <p class="subtitle" id="h.h8y4qh7b4e59">Credit cards are an outdated technology rife with problems such as fraud. Cryptocurrency can offer solutions.</p>
    <p>Everyone relies heavily on credit cards, but the technology behind them is outdated and prone to fraud. When making a purchase, online or in-person, you are essentially handing over access to all of your funds every time you provide your credit card information. There is nothing preventing someone from fraudulently charging more than an agreed amount once they have the information you provided. </p>
    <p>When paying with cryptocurrency, you are not handing over access to all of your funds. Rather, you&apos;re specifically providing the required information and amount needed to execute the transaction. Companies that accept credit cards online might not act maliciously, but once you provide our data to them, they are responsible for keeping that data private. As mentioned earlier, these data repositories are goldmines for hackers. This problem does not exist with cryptocurrency, as no sensitive information has to be stored.</p>
    <p>Merchants also suffer from credit card&apos;s technology and processes. Consistent cash flow might not be a problem for large corporations, but it certainly is for small and medium sized businesses. You provide your goods and services, only for the real owner of the credit card to report fraud. The money is then taken from you and given back to the real owner of the card. Even though you as a merchant did nothing wrong.</p>
