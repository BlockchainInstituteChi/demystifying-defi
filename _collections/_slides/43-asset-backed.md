  <p class="subtitle">Some cryptocurrencies are backed by the value of physical assets like gold.</p>

  <h4>Digix Gold</h4>

  <p>Some stablecoin creators have decided to use assets to back the value of their token. For example, Digix has released the Digix Gold Token. Each token is supposed to be backed by a gram of gold in a vault in Singapore. Gold is a notoriously stable asset. This has allowed the Digix Gold Token to fluctuate only 25% since 2016. </p>
