  <p></b>Introduce Vitalik and team while going over the stated goals of ethereum and how they contrast with Bitcoin.</b></p>
  <p>It would be accurate to state that ethereum was greatly influenced by Bitcoin. Beyond the obvious commonality of using blockchain technology, the advancement of both projects are linked in interesting ways. ethereum was largely an advancement in blockchains that was inspired by some perceived deficiencies in Bitcoin. Bitcoin was the pioneer that paved the road that is blockchain technology. ethereum would act as a tool to allow development on that paved road.</p>
  <p>Ethereum started with a few simple ideas. Vitalik Buterin was a 19-year-old programmer who had a fascination with all things decentralized. This led Vitalik to work on the colored coins project, which he eventually stopped working on when it became apparent that the Bitcoin blockchain could not fully support the project. During this time, a team was formed to work on ethereum. Vitalik was a Bitcoin enthusiast, but he recognized some inherent limitations that burdened Bitcoin.</p>
