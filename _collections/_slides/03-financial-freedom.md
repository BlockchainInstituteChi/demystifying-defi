    <p>Narrative: Bitcoin is about financial freedom</p>
    <p>Do you have financial freedom, in other words, do you have control over your own money?</p>
    <p>That money is in a bank, right? And what if you want to do something a bank deems not ok? This isn&apos;t just some hypothetical situation. It is happening today.</p>
    <h4>Examples</h4>
    <h5>Cannabis industry:</h5>
    <p>The growth of the cannabis industry in parts of the United States has come with some legal complications. While many states have made the move to legalize the recreational use of marijuana, it is still considered illegal on the federal level. This variance between the state and federal level greatly affects the ability of the cannabis industry to conduct basic business activities. Since banks fall under federal jurisdiction, they refuse to allow any cannabis-related industry to conduct any banking activity, as this would violate the federal laws they are forced to follow. The result is a very cash-heavy industry, which creates problems with security and cash flow. </p>
    <h5>Crypto purchases (2017):</h5>
    <p>2017 was a huge year for cryptocurrencies, as the price of these assets rapidly increased. Many people rushed to buy cryptocurrency, but some buyers found out that purchasing these cryptocurrencies could result in your bank account being shut down. Many purchases were just simply rejected. Buying cryptocurrency was perfectly legal, but banks treated that activity as forbidden. This wasn&apos;t simply because of legal liability, but rather a form of protectionism by the industry that cryptocurrency aimed to disrupt.</p>
