    <p class="subtitle">Bitcoin Pizza Day commemorates the first documented purchase of a physical good using bitcoin. </p>
    <p>On May 22, 2010, now known as Bitcoin Pizza Day, Laszlo Hanyecz agreed to pay 10,000 Bitcoins for two delivered Papa John&apos;s pizzas. Organized on bitcointalk forum, the Florida man reached out for help. &quot;I&apos;ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas.. like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day,&quot; Hanyecz wrote.</p>
    <p>A London based member of the forum took Laszlo up on the offer, which was a fairly savvy move even at the time, considering that 10k Bitcoin amounted to 41$ dollars and the pizza purchase cost just 25$, instantly turning this user a modest profit.</p>
    <p>So some might criticize Laszlo for making a purchase that probably doesn&apos;t look so hot in hindsight, considering the amount of Bitcoin he paid for two pizzas totaling 25$ is now worth $80,000,000. But Laszlo himself doesn&apos;t regret the purchase: He stated &quot;It wasn&apos;t like Bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool,&quot; Hanyecz told the NY Times. </p>
    <p>So many bitcoin enthusiasts get together to celebrate bitcoin pizza day by doing two of the things they love, eating pizza, and talking bitcoin.</p>
