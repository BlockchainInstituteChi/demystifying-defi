    <p class="subtitle">A blockchain&apos;s transparent nature means it is not practical for certain applications considering all data transacted is transparent.</p>
    <p>Why this is problematic?</p>
    <p>You wouldn&apos;t want to put your certain personal data, like medical records, on a public blockchain for anyone to see. Even if this data is encrypted now, there is no guarantee that the encryption won&apos;t be broken in the future.</p>
    <p>Another issue is that data is only needed for a certain amount of time. Data resides on the blockchain forever, but some data becomes irrelevant after a certain amount of time.</p>
