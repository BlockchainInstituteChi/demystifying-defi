  <p class="subtitle">Bitcoin's block time of 10 minutes was reduced to just 10 seconds in the ethereum network. These faster confirmation times allow for the quicker processing of data. It is this characteristic that allows ethereum to act as a functional decentralized platform.</p>
  <p>In order to reach their goals of being a world decentralized computer, the ethereum blockchain had to find a way to process data more quickly than the Bitcoin network. The developers found that if they greatly decreased Bitcoin's block time, more data could be processed by the network. ethereum set their block times to be around ten seconds each, several times faster than each Bitcoin block is created.</p>
  <p>And it had to be this way. For decentralized applications to work, requests have to be received and fulfilled by the network quickly. You're not going to use a decentralized application that takes several minutes to process each action you are trying to complete; it just isn't feasible. 
A robust decentralized platform with functional decentralized applications would process each action quickly and fluidly, allowing users to interact with dApps without having to wait minutes for the latest data request to be processed.</p>
  <p>Although ethereum was limited in the amount of data it could fit into each block, this network construction and block time decrease was better suited to act as a platform for decentralized applications than Bitcoin.</p>
