notes: |
  <p class="subtitle">The transparent nature of a blockchain and the lack of a central administrator means that no individual can censor or remove transactions. The gatekeeping role traditionally filled by banks does not exist in DeFi ecosystems.</p>

  <p>Previously we have seen banks censor purchases or actually stop them from going through. While banks have a legal obligation to not do business with certain entities, we've seen banks and payment processors stop legitimate transactions from going through. Different legalities in unique jurisdictions further complicate this matter.</p>
    
  <p>For example, 2017 and 2018 saw some banks decline to process transactions involving the purchase of cryptocurrency. This anticompetitive behavior only seeks to fulfill the interests of the banks, not the average person.</p>
    
  <p>An open DeFi system using blockchain technology doesn't just provide some guarantee against censorship of valid transactions, it provides an opportunity to those who have been disenfranchised from banking services.</p>
