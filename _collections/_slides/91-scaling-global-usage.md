    <p class="subtitle">The scaling dilemma refers to the blockchain&apos;s limitations concerning transaction throughput.</p>
    <p>One of the biggest problems facing blockchains is their ability to process transactions fast enough so a backlog doesn&apos;t occur. Since they rely on decentralized technology and not a central server, blockchains can only process a few transactions per second. Currently, Visa processes about 1600 transactions per second. When increased demand is put on the network, fees and backlogs occur. Scaling describes the process of trying to get blockchains processed transactions per second closer to that of Visa, as to avoid these &#x201C;traffic jams&#x201D; of transactions that cause high user fees.</p>
    <p>Decentralized networks come with a tradeoff, it requires multiple nodes processing information as opposed to one central server. Since every node validates every transaction, it takes work and time to update everyone&apos;s ledger. A centralized process requires fewer people to know about the transaction, and can therefore process these transactions at a faster rate.</p>
    <p>Fortunately, there are many projects using a variety of strategies in order to solve this problem.</p>
    <p>One of these is the introduction of second layer solutions. Second layer solutions work in concert with blockchains. They process data locally, communicating with the blockchain every so often in order to update the master ledger. Since every transaction doesn&apos;t have to happen on chain, these networks reduce fees and backlogs. Not every node needs to know about these transactions, so it is done off chain on the &#x201C;second layer&#x201D;. There are many different second layer solutions that have been and are being explored.</p>
    <p>Another possible solution to the scaling problem is known as &#x201C;sharding&#x201D;. Basically, you are segmenting the blockchain into &#x201C;neighborhoods&#x201D; or sections, and users can only interact within their own segment of the blockchain. This helps with scaling but introduces a new set of problems. This segmentation of the blockchain makes it difficult to interact with someone outside of your &#x201C;neighborhood&#x201D;, as you need to lock your funds in your section of the blockchain.</p>
    <p>There are more solutions being explored than using second layers or sharding, and more strategies are constantly being explored.</p>
