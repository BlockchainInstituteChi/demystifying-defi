notes : 
    <p>By providing your currency pair to a liquidity pool can be done in order to receive a return on your staked cryptocurrency. Uniswap works with both ether and ERC-20 tokens, as long as the necessary liquidity is present in the pool.</p>
    <ul><li>Go to Uniswap and connect your Metamask wallet to the website. This allows your wallet to directly interact with the DEX</li>
    <li>In the upper left hand corner, select the “add liquidity” option</li>
    <li>Select the token pair you are willing to provide to the exchange. You must provide the same value in each currency in order to maintain balance for the liquidity pool</li>
    <li>Select the two assets that you are providing to the liquidity pool</li></ul>
    <p>You will be given exchange rates for each of the two currencies you are providing in order to make sure that you are providing equal value of each currency to the pool. You will also be told the percentage of the currency you provided in relation to the entire pool, helping you calculate the expected interest gained.</p>
    <p>Your pair is taken and you are given “pool tokens” that can be used to claim your rewards. To remove your provided liquidity to claim your rewards, select the pool option from Uniswap’s home page and select the “your liquidity” option.</p>
        <ul><li>Select remove liquidity</li>
        <li>Confirm the transaction using your metamask wallet. You’ll get your original tokens back plus the interest gained from providing your pair to the liquidity pool</li></ul>
