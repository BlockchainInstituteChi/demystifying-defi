  <p><b>The more individuals involved in the ecosystem, the more it will grow. Bitcoin transcends international money transfers, DeFi can do the same for financial services. The future of DeFi can include extreme growth in terms of capital locked in the DeFi ecosystem. More liquidity amounts to more competition. A robust DeFi ecosystem with easy to use tools and widespread capital availability can also help bank the unbanked.</b></p>
  <p>The lofty goal that DeFi is aiming for is to become as big as the current financial system. Again, this is the best case scenario for DeFi, but a lot needs to happen in order for the mass adoption of DeFi to become a reality. As previously mentioned, there has to be a significant amount of value and functionality offered by DeFi in order to amass enough capital to rival any traditional financial systems. If all of these challenges are met and solved, we will likely see the DeFi space continue to grow at a significant rate.</p>
  <p>Bitcoin showed us a glimpse of what money without borders looks like. DeFi has the promise to create a semi-unified financial system that completely transcends borders. This would be a monumental step toward equality, as everyone with an internet connection, including large numbers of unbanked individuals, is allowed to participate in the same system. In the developed world, most financial activities are closed off to certified brokers and traders. DeFi shatters these barriers. For the first time, you can both function without a bank while offering your own banking services.</p>
  <p>We touched on liquidity pools along with the growth of the money locked into DeFi contracts over time. There is already a good amount of capital available to receive as a DeFi loan. If more lenders get involved in these loans, there will be more competition among these lenders, driving down interest rates and benefiting the consumer. A large amount of capital within DeFi contracts will only make the ecosystem more resilient.</p>
  <p>As mentioned earlier, DeFI has the ability to bring in those who have been neglected by the banks. By offering these individuals and businesses more options and access to capital, a more equitable financial system is the result. DeFi isn't magically going to solve the needs of the unbanked overnight, but with Defi, there is more innovation in areas focused on the unbanked than ever before.</p>
