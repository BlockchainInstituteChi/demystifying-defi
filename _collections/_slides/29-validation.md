    <p class="subtitle">Once a transaction is broadcast, it is checked by other members of the network for validity.</p>
    <p>Before the transaction can be added to a block, it must be checked for validity (i.e. having the necessary funds to conduct the transaction). When your transaction is being broadcast, it and the other transactions are constantly being cross-checked by other nodes on the network. If the block&apos;s transactions are validated and that miner wins the race, that block (and therefore our transaction) is added to the chain.</p>
