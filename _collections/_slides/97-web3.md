    <p class="subtitle">Web3 can allow us greater control of our personal data.</p>
    <p>The goal of web3 is to bring decentralized technology to our internet. This allows us to remove intermediaries and means you can transact more directly. This can give creators more options on how to generate revenue, including microtransactions. Introducing digital uniqueness may give you better control over your personal data, allowing the internet as a playground for everyone and not only large corporations.</p>
    <p>While there is a long way to go before there is a complete functional decentralized web, blockchain technology has allowed us to have a goal to strive towards.</p>
