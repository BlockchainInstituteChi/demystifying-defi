    <p class="subtitle">Blockchain technology provides a public reciept that can improve upon current accounting and assurance practices.</p>
    <p>Accounting is all about, well, accountability. Everyone has heard of the term &#x201C;paper trail&#x201D;. When we&apos;re talking about accounting, that paper trail is receipts that show income and spending. Organizations and individuals have to compile a bunch of physical receipts and they digitize them or have accountants to the same thing. This is all done relying on a central server, a single source of truth. And that truth can be lost or compromised via malfunctions and hacks, respectively.</p>
    <p>Transparency expedites assurance. All federal income taxes are self-reporting, meaning that you have to figure out how much you owe or are owed. It&apos;s a backwards system where the government kind of knows how much you owe, makes you figure out that amount, and then makes sure you&apos;re correct. A set of ordered digital records on a decentralized network could add transparency to taxation that could essentially upend how you pay taxes. If digitally unique records are constantly updated, as opposed to reported once a year, tax settlement could occur more often, making triple-entry accounting a possible solution to expediting the taxation process.</p>
