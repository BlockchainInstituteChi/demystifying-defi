  <p class=subtitle>Go over one of the first dapps, Lighthouse, which was used for crowdfunding. Lighthouse could only allow ~200-250 donations per every 10 minutes due to blocksize constraints. Each transaction took up block space, creating network bloat and slowdowns. There needed to be another decentralized option that could process more data.</p>
  
  <p>Lighthouse's popularity also exposed its limitations (a recurring theme with blockchain based projects, they are limited by the platforms on which they are built). While the Bitcoin network could utilize smart contracts to facilitate crowdfunding. And it worked, to an extent. </p>
   
  <p>Lighthouse was able to facilitate fundraising using smart contracts on the Bitcoin network, but a previously mentioned limitation of Bitcoin caused issues. The block sizes and confirmation times of the Bitcoin networks protocol essentially limited how many transactions could be conducted daily. Since more data was required to utilize a smart contract as opposed to a simple transaction, Bitcoin blocks could only conduct so many of these transactions before their data limit was reached. Lighthouse could allow around 200-250 donations per block, but network bloat and slowdown always followed. Additionally, it was difficult for the network to close the ICO at a specific time or properly distribute tokens because Bitcoin is not Turing-complete. </p>
   
  <p>Mike Hearn became convinced that large-scale crowdfunding could not be achieved on Bitcoin. He predicted the scaling issues that Bitcoin would later face. It became clear to developers that other decentralized technologies had to be created.</p>
