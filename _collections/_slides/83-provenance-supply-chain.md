    <p class="subtitle">Blockchain technology can improve supply chain coordination by allowing different parties to work together as equal participants.</p>
    <p>When it comes to getting the products you buy on the shelves of your local market, there are many different people that have to work together. The supply chain describes how food or other goods get from their point of origin to their point of sale.</p>
    <p>Many different parties working together pose a problem. Who gets to be in charge? Who oversees the entire process? A central server is a possibility, but that would require all of the parties giving up control, and money, to an additional third-party that would make sure the entire process is executed before paying the individuals or businesses involved. Disputes, which are bound to happen, have no resolution. When a problem occurs, it is difficult to pinpoint the part of the supply chain that messed up. There is no dispute resolution mechanism in these contracts, and these issues often have to be resolved in a courtroom, incurring massive costs for everyone involved.</p>
    <p>When many parties are trying to do business with each other, decentralized technology provides a possible solution. Instead of one administrator having control of the process, each party has access to only the data they need to execute their part of the transaction. Use cases have included printing QR codes on eggs, where each time the product changes hands the codes are rescanned to make sure no damage has occured. A blockchain can provide digital uniqueness, complete with an immutable digital receipt, without the use of a central server.</p>
    <p>This technology has the potential to impact the supply chain, whether it be fighting food fraud, or enforcing fair trade policies. Immutable digital receipts can be used to settle many disputes.</p>
