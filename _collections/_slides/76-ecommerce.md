    <p class="subtitle">Many websites already accept cryptocurrency.</p>
    <p>So if you&apos;re making an online purchase, how are you going to do so? Probably a credit card. We already talked about why credit cards are such bad technology, remember it&apos;s like handing over your entire wallet and telling someone to take a few bucks out.</p>
    <p>If you use a credit card, that info has to get passed through a server, and it is often logged in a server. Credit cards are really bad tools when we&apos;re talking about the security of your funds.</p>
    <p>Crypto isn&apos;t like that. When you buy something with crypto online, you can send unencrypted information in a totally public manner and no one will have access to your funds. </p>
    <p>A great example of a cryptocurrency that is suited for the way content is consumed is BAT, or basic attention token. Instead of watching boring mandatory ads, you are rewarded for your attention by participating in interactive ads. The really cool part about BAT is it&apos;s already being used to tip independent creators that are beholden to platform restrictions. This also allows for all of the proceeds to go directly to the creator instead of a third party.</p>
