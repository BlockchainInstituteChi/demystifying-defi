    <dl>
        <dt>Block Time</dt>
        <dd>The amount of time it takes for miners to solve that math problem and compile valid transactions into a block. Different blockchains have different block times.</dd>
        <dt>Privacy</dt>
        <dd>Certain cryptocurrencies limit the amount of data that is publicly visible in order to ensure the maximum possible level of privacy.</dd>
        <dt>Community</dt>
        <dd>Each community is different, and are motivated by different values.</dd>
        <dt>Algorithms</dt>
        <dd>Blockchains require lots of computation, so a variety of consensus algorithms, state tracking, and hashing algorithms may be used.</dd>
