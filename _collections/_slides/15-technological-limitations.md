  <p class="subtitle">Bitcoin’s technical limitations led developers to seek other options. These limitations included Bitcoin’s block confirmation time and block size. Developers had a difficult time programming using the Bitcoin blockchain, so they looked towards better options.</p>
  <p>Satoshi Nakamoto was very clear about his intentions for the Bitcoin network. The stated goal laid out in the Bitcoin whitepaper states the network was designed to be a decentralized peer-to-peer cash system.</p>
  <p>As mentioned before, Bitcoin met this goal and is still doing so. It is a robust, resilient network that facilitates the transfer of value in a quick and inexpensive manner. However, some looked at the blockchain technology underlying the network and wondered if it could do more beyond simple cash transfers. Bitcoin was faced with a choice. The network was reaching capacity in terms of transaction throughput. The network was becoming clogged, resulting in increased fees. Since protocol changes are decided by the network, Bitcoin users were faced with a choice:</p>
  <p>The obvious answer was to decrease the size of block headers which would reduce the data processing burden on the network. This, however, would solidify Bitcoin's status as a cash transfer system which would be difficult to build upon because of data restrictions.</p>
  <p>This is an inherent limitation of the network. Developers that recognized the difficulty of building upon Bitcoin quickly explored other options, first on the Bitcoin network, then by creating blockchains of their own.</p>
