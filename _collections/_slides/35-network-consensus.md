notes: | 
    <p class="subtitle">This section explores how decentralized networks make decisions.</p>
    <p>Time to take you through the mining process and show you how the network deals with the problem of determining who has what when. This is done through a process where the goal of the network is to have every computer reach consensus (to come into agreement about) and have a copy of the public ledger.</p>
    <p>Who determines what transactions get included in a block? It&apos;s actually the miners who facilitate this process. Here&apos;s how the network makes a decision about what gets included inside of the next block. </p>
