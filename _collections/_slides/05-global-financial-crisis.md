notes: | 
    <p class="subtitle">The Global Financial Crisis heavily motivated the creation of Bitcoin.</p>
    <p>One of Satoshi&apos;s most famous messages was one that he embedded in the very first part of the Bitcoin blockchain. Known as the Genesis Block, this message was added permanently to the network:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>&#x201C;Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks&#x201D;</p>
        <cite>The Times</cite>
    </blockquote>
    <p>What can we tell from this message? Well, it isn&apos;t a stretch to think that the response to the global financial crisis had something to do with Bitcoin&apos;s birth. </p>
