notes: | 
    <p class="subtitle">Once a transaction is mined, it is added to a block. Each subsequent block further solidifies the position all previous blocks.</p>
    <p>Validated transactions compiled by miners are included in a block, the block is added to the chain. This counts as one confirmation, as the block has already been validated. Every subsequent block added counts as an additional confirmation. The more blocks added, the higher the chance of the transaction remaining part of the permanent chain.</p>
