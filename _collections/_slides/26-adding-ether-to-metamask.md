  <p class="videoNotes">If you currently have Ether in another wallet, getting your cryptocurrency into Metamask is as easy as conducting a simple transaction. Remember, Metamask functions as a cryptocurrency wallet. Upon downloading the extension for your first use, you are prompted to write down your seed phrase and are given a wallet address, just like other crypto wallets. Simply go to the wallet, select the buy cryptocurrency option, click on the “directly deposit ether” option, and put your Metamask wallet address in the receiving address field.  Once the transaction is mined and added to the blockchain, your funds will now be in your Metamask wallet. If anything happens to your computer or browser, simply use the provided seed phrase to restore your Metamask wallet.</p><p>Upon downloading Metamask, you’ll have two options: generate a new wallet and receive a new seed phrase, or restore an existing wallet using a seed phrase from a previous Metamask wallet. If you select the option to restore and enter in your seed phrase, your crypto will now be available in your Metamask wallet. Remember, your cryptocurrency exists on the blockchain. Your wallet manages your public and private keys in order to prove your ownership of that cryptocurrency.</p>
