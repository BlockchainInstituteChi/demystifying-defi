slideId: "hostile-attack"
type: left-right
notes: | 
    <p class="subtitle">51% attacks are malicious attempts to hijack the network by temporarily maintaining a majority of the network&apos;s hashing power.</p>
    <p>As previously mentioned, it is possible to buy or rent processing power in the hopes of taking over the majority of the network. Controlling a majority of this hashing power could allow rewriting of historic chain data. These attacks are expensive and difficult to sustain. </p>
    <p>It is important to ensure diversity of network participants while maintaining incentive alignment. There have been some mining pools that have approached controlling 51% of the network&apos;s hashing power. In response they have reduced mining as to preserve the long term health of the network, most likely so they can continue to reap block rewards in a healthy ecosystem.</p>
