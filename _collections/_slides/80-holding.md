    <p class="subtitle">HODLing is the practice of holding or amassing coins.</p>
    <p>Many cryptocurrency users look to save their crypto in the hopes that it will increase in value or functionality.  HODLling, pronounced as &#x201C;holding&#x201D;, is the practice of amassing some coins.</p>
    <p>This ecosystem is still developing, so there are many users who choose to simply hold their cryptocurrency. Hodling is partly investing, but speculating on the long term future utility instead of trading cryptocurrency.</p>
    <p>The misspelling of the term first caught steam on a Bitcoin related forum. At the time of the post, Bitcoin&apos;s price had gone down significantly for that relative time period. One user went on an epic rant, using the term &#x201C;hodl&#x201D; attached to the sentiment of weathering the hard times. The post went viral within the community, and soon embedded itself in the cryptocurrency lexicon. It became a rallying cry when crypto was having more downs than ups. It is still a popular meme used today.</p>
