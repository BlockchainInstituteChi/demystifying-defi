    <p class="subtitle">Tokens are introduced into the ecosystem through a unique feedback relationship.</p>
    <p>One of the most popular questions about mining concerns how tokens are introduced into the Bitcoin ecosystem. Tokens are created every time a block is mined, and rewarded to whichever miner wins the right to the next block. The maximum of bitcoin that will ever be mined is set at 21 million coins. The very first block, known as the genesis block, was mined by Satoshi Nakamoto, as were several successive blocks. The first block rewards were 50 bitcoin.</p>
    <p>This starts a unique repeating cycle that can be broken into four steps.</p>
