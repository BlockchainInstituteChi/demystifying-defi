    <p class="subtitle">Decentralized networks reach consensus through a process known as mining mining.</p>
    <p>So if no Bitcoin CEO is calling the shots, and no central server is making decisions, how does a decentralized network make decisions?</p>
    <p>Here&apos;s a diagram of a decentralized network, and notice the difference in structure compared to that hub and spoke centralized model. </p>
    <p>Every single node on the network is either directly or indirectly connected, creating an egalitarian web of decentralized nodes. Egalitarian is a great word to use when describing a blockchain, since no one entity is calling the shots, and all have access to the network.</p>
    <p>Look at what happens during a transaction in a decentralized network. One individual is sending out a bitcoin transaction, not specifically to any one of these nodes. When he does send his transaction out, it is broadcast to the rest of the network. At this point, the network has to come into agreement about that transaction. The process of the network coming to a decision in order to validate transactions is what&apos;s known as reaching consensus. Another way to explain consensus would be nodes coming into agreement on a constantly updating public ledger.</p>
    <p>Nodes on the network known as mining nodes are the users that are compiling valid data onto the blockchain. This process is also known as mining, and miners have an important decision making role in the ecosystem. </p>
    <p>Miners decide who has what when by compiling transactions into a data holding &#x201C;vehicle&#x201D; known as a block. Simply put, blocks are the things that hold batches of transactions. These miners are racing to form a block by solving a really tough math problem (one that takes these powerful computers an average of 10 minutes to solve) in order to get the right to compile transactions into a block. Why are they racing for the right to compile the next block? The winner of this mathematical race that puts forward a block full of valid transactions that gets added to the chain is compensated with what&apos;s known as a block reward, and today that reward is 6.25 bitcoin per block.</p>
