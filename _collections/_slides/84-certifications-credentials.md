    <p class="subtitle">Blockchains can limit academic fraud by keeping records of professional certifications.</p>
    <p>Credentialing limits academic fraud. People lie about who they are to their own benefit, and that can have dangerous results. </p>
    <p>Currently, credentials are issued or monitored by private organizations. The problem with this is that this information is not easily accessible to patients, academics, or other people trying to verify the credentials of the professionals they need to interact with. </p>
    <p>Some of these organizations are looking to decentralized technologies to make credentials more transparent to assure public trust. The public has a right to know that their doctor isn&apos;t a 16 year old kid that hasn&apos;t graduated medical school. By adding the elements of a doctor&apos;s CV to a blockchain, a digitally unique history can established for service providers</p>
    <p>The solution is to make this information, these credentials, available to several nodes on a decentralized network, and allowing other nodes to verify and reference that information. </p>
    <p>Using a blockchain, immutable certificates and degrees can be compiled in a chronological order. License revoked? An additional entry could be added to the blockchain noting this occurrence. </p>
    <p>References can be logged, creating a digitally unique profile of each author&apos;s works.</p>
