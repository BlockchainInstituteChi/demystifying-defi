    <p class="subtitle">The characteristics of money apply to cryptocurrency.</p>
    <p>First, it has to be a reliable store of value. Money has to have consistent value and purchasing power so faith can be put in that currency, otherwise, no one is going to accept it. If a unit of currency varies from 1.50 one day and .50 another, no one is going to accept that currency.</p>
    <p>Money also has to be used as a medium of exchange. People have to be willing to spend and accept that asset for it to be a medium of exchange. Lastly, money has to act as a unit of account, to be able to tell who has what at any given time.</p>
    <p>So a logical question would be to use these standards to assess if cryptocurrency is considered money. While cryptocurrency hasn&apos;t been the most stable of assets, the most popular cryptocurrencies have shown some degree of stability, especially after accounting for lifetime growth. While most of the business world isn&apos;t quite ready to accept bitcoin, there are several that are offering that option. This shows that at least some are willing to accept cryptocurrency. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies employ public ledgers, which act as a great way to track who has what assets. It&apos;s not a far stretch to say that cryptocurrency satisfies several of the characteristics of money.</p>
