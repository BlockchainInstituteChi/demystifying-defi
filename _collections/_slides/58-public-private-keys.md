    <p class="subtitle">Public and private keys are linked, allowing anybody to send you a transaction. The user with the private key controls the associated cryptocurrency.</p>
    <p>When downloading a cryptocurrency wallet, every single user is provided with a pair of keys that are cryptographically linked. Your public key can be shared with anybody. It functions as a public address that can be on the receiving end of transactions. You are also assigned a private key which is the master password to your cryptocurrency. Unlike the appropriately named public key, the private key is not ever meant to be shared. The person who controls the private key controls the associated public key&apos;s cryptocurrency.</p>
    <h5>Example:</h5>
    <p>The best real world analogy is that of a locked mailbox. Everyone has access to your address, just like with a public key. Anybody can drop a message or funds in your mailbox, but only you have access to the key that opens the mailbox. This key is analogous to a private key. </p>
