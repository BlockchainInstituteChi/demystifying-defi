  <p class="subtitle">Colored coins were an attempt at creating non-fungible tokens. The implication of colored coins for block sizes and chain use.</p>
  <p>Colored coins were the first attempt to expand bitcoin's utility beyond the simple transfer of value. Normal bitcoins are divisible to many decimal places. One bitcoin can be divided into smaller units, especially useful considering bitcoin's high price. It simply wouldn't be practical if you could only transfer a whole bitcoin at once.</p>
  <p>Like any viable currency, a single bitcoin can be divided into "change". Without this functionality, a peer-to-peer cash transfer system would likely not be able to function properly. It would be like trying to pay for a $20 product with a $100 bill without the ability to get your $80 in change.</p>
  <p>When developers looked to add other functionalities to the Bitcoin blockchain, one of the first things they incorporated were units known as colored coins. They realized that if they could create tokens that could not be divisible, or non-fungible, in order to represent real-world assets that cannot be divided.</p>
  <p>For example, it wouldn't make sense to create multiple tokens to represent the deed to one house. You would need a different type of non-fungible token, or NFTs, in order to represent nondivisible assets. If this could be accomplished, then the Bitcoin blockchain could function as a decentralized digital asset manager.</p>
