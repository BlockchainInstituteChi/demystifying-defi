    <p class="subtitle">Each node has a copy of the blockchain, and offline users can get a copy of the most updated ledger once they log back on.</p>
    <p>You don&apos;t have to be online to receive your funds. Remember, each node has a copy of the blockchain, the ledger with the complete transaction history. If you&apos;re not online, your ledger won&apos;t get updated, but everyone else&apos;s ledger will. When your node logs back online, it uses the other nodes to synchronize the transactions that occurred while your node was offline.</p>
