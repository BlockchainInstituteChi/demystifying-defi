    <p class="subtitle">Once a transaction is securely signed, it is broadcast to other nodes on the network.</p>
    <p>Once the transaction is initiated, it is broadcast to the nodes on the network. At this point the miners race to put transactions into a block, but blocks have data size limits and can only hold so much transaction data. A large amount of transactions congesting the network might mean that your transaction doesn&apos;t get included in this first block that is created but will eventually be included in a subsequent block. So what happens in this waiting period between broadcasting and mining?</p>
