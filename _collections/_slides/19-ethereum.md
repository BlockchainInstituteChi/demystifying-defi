  <p><b>Ethereum addressed Bitcoin's ability to act as a decentralized world computer by introducing a network that could process data as a Turing-complete network. This next section is a basic intro to ethereum.</b></p>
  <p>After seeing the complications with colored coins and Mastercoin, the challenges of expanding the Bitcoin protocol towards a financial platform looked to be a very difficult task. In 2015, a group of like-minded developers, led by Vitalik Buterin, created a decentralized computing platform that could effectively process data without the use of a central server.</p>
  <p>These developers were motivated by the lack of ability to create smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain. After participating in projects such as colored coins, it became clear that in order to reach the goal of decentralized computing and development, a new blockchain would have to be created. Smart contracts were too much for the existing Bitcoin blockchain, but what if there was a blockchain specifically designed for the development of smart contract based decentralized applications.</p>
  <p>In 2015 the ethereum Blockchain was launched.</p>
