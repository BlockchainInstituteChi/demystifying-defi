  <p><b>Mastercoin used data management to improve upon the Bitcoin network.</b></p>
  <p>Some developers knew of the limitations of developing upon the Bitcoin network. But what if they could add another layer to the existing Bitcoin protocol in order to facilitate capabilities including the deployment of smart contracts and creating new virtual currencies? This question was explored in 2013 by a project known as Mastercoin. Its goal was to create a robust, decentralized digital economy that could utilize the capabilities of smart contracts.</p>
  <p>By creating this second layer, Mastercoin theoretically could add these capabilities to the Bitcoin network without altering the protocol itself. It would work in addition to, not instead of, Bitcoin. Successfully implementing this functionality would have allowed Bitcoin to move past simple money transfer; the network could be used to manage things like assets, stocks, and other investments. Users could trade in their bitcoin to receive a newly created alt-coin that would be native to the mastercoin network. This was achieved by adding a bit of code at the end of Bitcoin transactions in order to manage the transfer of Mastercoins.</p>
  <p>This, however, created a major problem. Since the Bitcoin protocol could not properly govern the actions of Mastercoin, users could possibly manipulate the Mastercoin network. Additionally, there was dispute within the community that Mastercoin could sufficiently deploy and house smart contracts. The project was rebranded to Omni in 2015. However, that year another blockchain-based platform would be introduced.</p>
