  <p class="subtitle">The ability for Ethereum to act as a platform for decentralized applications has made it the go-to development sandbox for DeFi applications.These dApps are built in a modular, collaborative way, with open-source software being the norm for DeFi dApps. The open-source nature of this software plays a big part in the development of this ecosystem. All smart contracts that govern dApps are transparent; anyone can audit the code and then incorporate that tool or feature into their own project.</p>
  <p>With so many young projects in the ecosystem, the first decentralized applications had to deal with crowdfunding. One of the first projects to do this was Lighthouse, a crowdfunding application built upon the Bitcoin network.</p>
  <p>In 2015, Mike Hearn launched Lighthouse as a decentralized crypto crowdfunding application. Lighthouse touted that it had made the process of decentralized crowdfunding possible by using smart contracts. Lighthouse was a hit, with users eager to help fund development of projects they believed in or specific charitable causes. However, it soon became clear that the Bitcoin chain was limiting  Lighthouseâ€™s capabilities.</p>
