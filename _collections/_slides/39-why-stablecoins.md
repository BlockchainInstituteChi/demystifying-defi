  <p class="subtitle">Explain the purpose of stablecoins and some parties that may be answered in utilizing this technology. Start to explore the role that stablecoins play in the DeFi ecosystem.</p>

  <p>The frequent price changes we see in the digital currency market has slowed down the mass adoption of cryptocurrency. A merchant is not going to be keen to accept a volatile asset, as a steep drop in price could happen overnight. A cryptocurrency used to buy a good may be worth a dollar at the time of purchase. That value may decline 15% overnight, and the merchant is stuck with 85 cents on the dollar. Volatility has the potential to disrupt the steady business operations conducted by small and medium-sized businesses. Put simply, volatile assets are not ideal for everyday spending for either the purchaser or seller.</p>

  <p>Additionally, some investors and speculators have shown a reluctance to part with their volatile cryptocurrency. While many express desire to buy goods with cryptocurrency, some own cryptocurrency as an investment and are more concerned in holding the asset in the hopes it will appreciate over time. A major hurdle to cryptocurrency's mass adoption is the volatility in the price of even the most popular cryptocurrencies. The value of the bitcoin used to buy two pizzas, the first recorded physical purchase using the cryptocurrency, went from roughly $41 at the time of purchase to a value of above $200M at bitcoin’s price high in late 2020.</p>

  <p>No one wants to accept a currency that could be of significantly less value just a day later. Many don't want to make purchases using cryptocurrency because they fear missing out on a rapid price gain. Volatility acts as a hurdle for sellers because of the prospect the asset will not maintain its value. Volatility is a problem for consumers, who are reluctant to part with an asset that has the ability for possible exponential growth. Digital spending has increased, but volatile cryptocurrencies are yet to gain mainstream adoption. As a result, we’re seeing a push to create reliable, stable cryptocurrencies that hold their value corresponding to a certain currency. These cryptocurrencies are known as stablecoins. </p>

  <h4>Merchant Perspective</h4>

  <p>Stablecoins allow merchants to accept digital currency while knowing the value of the stablecoin will not drastically change over time. Mainstream cryptocurrency adoption has yet to fully take hold in part because the unsteady nature of cryptocurrency prices makes them unrealistic to accept as a merchant. Most cryptocurrencies can be easily converted to stablecoins, allowing merchants confidence that their coins will maintain their value. </p>

  <p>However, not all merchants may want to convert all of their received cryptocurrency to stablecoins. Merchants can use a percentage of cryptocurrency as non-stablecoin investments if they desire. Investments could be increased or decreased based off of the willingness for the merchants to invest. Of course, any cryptocurrency kept can be converted to stablecoins if an investment strategy changes.</p>

  <p>There are several services that will convert the majority of a customer’s volatile cryptocurrencies into stablecoins, while either keeping the coin as an investment or even converting the customer’s token into one the merchant would rather have as an investment.</p>

  <h4>Stability in the Face of Hyperinflation</h4>

  <p>As previously illustrated, vast change in value isn’t always desired. Stability may be prioritized in order to protect value over time. While many leading economies maintain a relatively stable currency, monetary stability is a luxury in other places of the world. Zimbabwe, Venezuela, and Turkey are all examples of countries that have experienced relatively recent currency crises. </p>

  <p>The introduction of stablecoins to these economies offers an option to hedge against a wildly fluctuating currency, whether it be fiat or crypto. We have seen cryptocurrencies utilized in economies that experience hyperinflation, and many get stuck with fiat currency that is worth practically nothing. What if these citizens had a different option other than storing their wealth in a hyperinflated currency? </p>

  <p>The consistency of stablecoins offers those in failing economies an option. The relationship between stablecoins and a country’s fiat currency is yet to be determined and likely will vary depending on the unique economic situation that each faces. A failing currency may fall even more if a stablecoin option is introduced. Stablecoins act as a bridge from fiat to cryptocurrency. </p>

  <h4>Stablecoins and Markets</h4>

  <p>You cannot simply go to a bank and purchase cryptocurrencies, at least not yet. We are seeing the rise of cryptocurrency ATMs, but they have yet to gain mainstream popularity. Cryptocurrency is usually purchased at an online exchange, but there are not many fiat-to-cryptocurrency markets. Instead, stablecoins are used as an intermediary tool for market pairing. It would be difficult to create separate markets for each fiat-to-crypto market. Instead, fiat can be converted to a popular stablecoin that has many different market pairings. Tether was one of the earliest stablecoins to gain popularity. As a result, most exchanges offered markets with BTC(Bitcoin), ETH(Ethereum), and USDT(Tether) pairs.</p>

  <p>It is often difficult to trade less popular tokens directly for other tokens. Again, too many markets would have to be created on an exchange. Instead, tokens are traded for more popular cryptocurrencies or stablecoins which can then be used to trade for other tokens. Converting to fiat currency is expensive and untimely. Stablecoins allow for the quick transfer and settlement of funds, allowing for a more consistent and reliable cash flow.</p>
