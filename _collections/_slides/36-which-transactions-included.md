    <p class="subtitle">In-depth explanation of mining mechanics and hashing power.</p>
    <p>The transactions that are included in a block are determined by the miner that wins the race. Competing miners may pick different valid transactions from the mempool. For example, let&apos;s say that the race has come down to two miners, one of which will win and write the next block. The transactions that the winning miner chooses from the mempool are added to the blockchain, while the losing miners transactions are sent back to the mempool to be picked by another miner. These transactions will most likely be mined eventually, even though they were not included in the first winner&apos;s block. The process repeats and miners try to compile a valid block while winning the mathematical race.</p>
    <p>Mining power is measured in a unit known as hashing power, and it comes from the processing units used by miners. Not every miner has the same amount of hashing power. Some entities have spent lots of money on miners in the hopes of generating an even greater return via block rewards. It is important to note that the miner with the highest hashing power does not always win the mathematical race. Think of it as a normal math problem presented to a classroom full of students. The ability of each student to solve this problem differs and the students that are better at solving math problems have a greater chance of solving a proposed problem. However, the student that is best at math isn&apos;t always going to be the first one to solve every problem. The students that are less good at math, or have less processing power, still have a chance to beat the best problem solver in the class.</p>
    <p>The effort to gain as much processing power as possible has made it difficult for the average person to compete against these miners with significant hashing power. This has led to the formation of mining pools, where individuals pool their hashing power together in the hopes of winning more block rewards and competing with larger mining operations. The reward distribution usually corresponds with the amount of hashing power provided to the pool.</p>
