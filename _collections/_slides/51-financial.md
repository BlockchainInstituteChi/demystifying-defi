  <p class="subtitle">DeFi has recreated the financial system we are used to in a way that connects users without the use of a central entity. As a result, the investments that have traditionally been reserved for banks and certain individuals are now a realistic option for the average cryptocurrency user.</p>
  <p>The innovation of decentralized technology has opened up a new realm of possibilities for how we can conduct necessary financial services. New financial instruments that have been traditionally reserved only for banks and select investors are now being brought to the cryptocurrency world.</p>
  <p>Finance is a very general term, and there is a lot to that field. A variety of the features of the traditional financial system are being introduced to the crypto ecosystem. Just because finance has been decentralized doesn’t change the core goal: invest money in the hopes of gaining more money. There is a saying that goes along the lines of “make your money work for you”. All this phrase really means is investing your money in order to let it grow as opposed to keeping all of your funds in low-interest-bearing accounts.</p>
  <p>The only issue with this? Centralized systems use gatekeeping tactics and take high fees for the services they provide. And they don’t always have their customer’s best interests in mind, as we saw during the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
  <p>DeFi has given users the opportunity to bypass these centralized systems. Instead of letting their fiat money work for them, they now have the option to enter into a system where their cryptocurrency can yield more cryptocurrency. The term assigned to investing your cryptocurrency for growth is, appropriately, yield farming.</p>
