  <p><b>The modular nature of DeFi dapps allows developers to pick and choose different tools to form a new innovation.</b></p>
  <p>DeFi's modular nature makes it more of a sandbox than a set concept; people are constantly innovating, sharing tools to make a better decentralized application or to improve an existing one. The culture is one of open-source collaboration, where every project wins if some find success, proving the usefulness of decentralized finance.</p>
  <p>So what are some of these innovations that people are creating? We'll take a deep dive into the different types of DeFi dApps that have already proven  their concept and found some popularity. In the next section, we'll explore the different types of decentralized finance applications that are being created. We will also examine some successful projects in the DeFi space.</p>
