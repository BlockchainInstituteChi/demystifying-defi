notes: | 
    <p class="subtitle">There is no central administrator in the Bitcoin network, the governance is administered by the community</p>
    <p>Let&apos;s start with an important thing to remember about Bitcoin, it&apos;s just software. It&apos;s what is known as open-source software, where all code is public and can therefore be audited. That&apos;s where trusting the system comes into play. Anyone can look at the code, download it, and run the Bitcoin protocol on their computer. Computers that are running the software and are part of the network are referred to as nodes. These nodes make up a decentralized network.</p>
    <p>It&apos;s also important to know that there is no central Bitcoin company and there is no Bitcoin CEO. The software is open source and can be downloaded by anyone. Changes to the code in the Bitcoin software can be made by users and adopted by the network. This is what makes Bitcoin bailout-proof. Even if you wanted to &#x201C;bailout&#x201D; the network, it would be impossible. That&apos;s the nature of a decentralized project.</p>
