notes: 
  <p class="subtitle">The tools that make up the DeFi ecosystem are still being developed. While they are not the most intuitive applications, they are well on their way.</p>
  <p>DeFi offers a lot of new options, but those new options come with the typical problems that face new innovations. Once the dApp's concept has been proven, it often takes some time to enhance the user experience. Most DeFi apps were very confusing to use when they were first released. However, as the ecosystem has developed, these dApps have become gradually easier to use.</p>
  <p>If these dApps are to reach widespread success, they are going to have to become seamless to use. Once these dApps become as simple to use as a centralized banking or money transfer app, like PayPal, users will gradually become part of the ecosystem because of all of the benefits DeFi has to offer.</p>
