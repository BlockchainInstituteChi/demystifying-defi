notes: | 
    <p class="subtitle">Transaction receipts can help diagnose frequently encountered problems.</p>
    <p>Not all transactions are immediately mined, miners choose the transactions with the highest fees attached. If your transaction hasn&apos;t gone through after a while, it is likely stuck in the mempool because of insufficient fees. </p>
    <p>The good part, many wallets will let you set a fee or a range that allows you to select the type of fee you are willing to pay. The higher the fee, the quicker the transaction will be picked up by a miner and put into a block.</p>
    <p>How can you tell where your transaction is? Checking the block explorer allows you to view the status of your transaction in real time.</p>
