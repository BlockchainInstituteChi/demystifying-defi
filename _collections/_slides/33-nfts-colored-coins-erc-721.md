  <p class="subtitle">Bitcoin's colored coins met limitations that were addressed by the ERC-721 standard for non-fungible tokens. ERCs are often token standards voted on by the community. These standards are set to ensure interoperability between tokens and wallets.</p>
  
  <p>We've already discussed the colored coins project that ultimately lost momentum, but that did not end the attempts to make a non-fungible token to represent assets. </p> 
  
  <p>Non-fungible tokens are different from their fungible counterparts because they cannot be divided. What is the purpose of having such tokens? Well to represent real world assets that cannot be divided, like a house of a car. Non-fungible tokens would allow for these assets to be represented on the blockchain, essentially opening up several possible decentralized finance applications.</p>
    
  <p>With the creation of non-fungible tokens, the terms of a loan could be properly expressed with all of the information living on a blockchain.</p> 
    
  <h4>History of NFTs</h4> 
    
  <p>Some of the first test cases of NFTs occurred when some municipalities decided they wanted to digitize paper records, mainly the deeds to houses. These paper records are usually kept in storage and could get lost or destroyed over time. That is especially concerning if these deeds are the only proof of who owns that property. </p> 
    
  <p>Like many things with Ethereum based dApps, we had to walk before we could run. We needed to see a solid NFT proof of concept, hopefully one that would be relatively popular. That project came up in the most unlikely of forms: Digital cats.</p> 
    
  <p>Yes, you read that correctly. Cryptokitties was a dApp that facilitated the transfer of ERC-721 (non-fungible) tokens in the form of collectible kitties. Each cat had a unique set of features based on their hash; parts of the embedded transaction data would result in specific physical characteristics, some more rare than others. </p> 
    
  <p>These non-fungible kitties were sold on a market through the cryptokitties website. People we're making actual cryptocurrency from flipping cryptokitties. Later functionality allowed a pair of cryptokitties to "reproduce" to form a new NFT.</p> 
      
  <p>The decentralized community went crazy for this idea, and the unintentional result was that the Ethereum network's ability to meet real world demand would be tested. The network was not quite ready for the challenge. The months that saw the height of cryptokitty popularity posed the toughest challenge for the network. Backlogs occurred, fees went up. The network slowed to a crawl. This made a couple of things clear. The first is that NFTs had proven themselves to be useful in terms of tracking non fungible collectibles or assets. The second was that the network still had work to do in order to scale to meet real world demand.</p>
