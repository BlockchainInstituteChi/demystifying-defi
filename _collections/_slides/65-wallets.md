  <p><b>Reiterate the purpose of a cryptocurrency wallet. 
-Why decentralize wallets? 
-Custodial vs non-custodial wallets. 
-How are decentralized wallets different from their counterparts? 
-Introduce Coinbase Wallet and Brave Browser</b></p>
  <p>Utilizing decentralized applications requires at least one transaction of data between your node and a blockchain. This could be as simple as having your wallet automatically paired with a decentralized browser, or it could involve multiple transactions depending on what type of dApp you're using and what you're trying to accomplish. Executing a simple decentralized swap takes one transaction. Playing a game that has to sync with a blockchain constantly takes many transactions. ethereum has limited resources, so the scaling issue must be solved for the latter category of dApps to function smoothly.</p>
  <p>One of these wallets that can also function as a dApp browser is Coinbase Wallet. Formerly Toshi Wallet, the dApp was ultimately acquired by Coinbase. You might be thinking to yourself that Coinbase is a centralized exchange, but this is a stand-alone dApp that allows users to store cryptocurrency while browsing popular dApps, which the browser can help direct you to. Coinbase Wallet has shortcuts to several dApps and allows you to manually browse others. Coinbase Wallet and other dApp browsers seamlessly incorporate a wallet while you're browsing dApps.</p>
  <p>Contrary to the Coinbase exchange, Coinbase Wallet users manage and control their private keys, assuring them complete security when storing their crypto on the dApp. This is especially useful, considering these tools previously had to be used separately. There have been other dApps that have tried to bridge the gap between wallets and the decentralized web, using innovative tools to integrate them.</p>
  <p>Brave Browser is another way to connect to the decentralized web. When it comes to dApps, Brave is one of the most intuitive out there, mainly because it is designed to look at function like the Google Chrome Browser. The lack of a learning curve makes it a really easy way to interact with dApps. Additionally, it has a variety of cool features that make it a very attractive dApp to use.</p>
  <p>Brave is all about preservation of privacy, allowing you to share the data you want to share and interact with an advertisement only when you want to do so. If you don’t want those pesky ads appearing, you can turn on Brave’s built-in adblocker.  Like Coinbase Wallet, Brave has a cryptocurrency wallet that can be used to interact with dApps. One of the more exciting developments that Brave is currently implementing is compatibility with IPFS, a decentralized file storage protocol.</p>
