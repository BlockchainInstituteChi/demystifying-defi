    <p class="subtitle">Digital uniqueness was enabled by the creation of Bitcoin. Its creation addressed if a financial system can exist without centralized action and authority.</p>
    <p>A blockchain is a record of transactions, like a traditional ledger. These transactions can be any movement of money, goods or secure data&#x2014;a purchase at a supermarket, for example, or the assignment of any government issued ID number.</p>
    <p>Blockchain provides a cryptographically secured ordering of transactions, and uses a practice known as &#x201C;triple-entry accounting&#x201D;. Traditionally, both the creditor and debtor each keep their own ledger of their business transactions. Blockchain transactions come with an additional public receipt that reflects this transfer of funds. Essentially, a transparent receipt with verified details is provided to the entire network.</p>
