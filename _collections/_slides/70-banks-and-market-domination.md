  <p class="subtitle">What is preventing mass adoption from occurring? People are unaware of another option outside of the existing systems. As this is a new innovation, there is bound to be some time between DeFi emergence and the availability of funds that can be dedicated to the system. How does DeFi get to a point where it can compete with traditional finance? 
  -Competitive rates and returns 
  -More personal financial control 
  -Ease of use 
  -Access to global markets 
  -Banking the Unbanked</p>
  <p>Another issue that is preventing DeFi from gaining massive popularity is a simple lack of awareness. Never before has an alternative financial system been an option. Now that another option exists, it is a matter of breaking the centralized banking habits we have had for centuries.</p>
  <p>Since the beginning of civilization, we have relied on large, centralized institutions in order to store our money and conduct banking services. Ever since we started living in concentrated societies, this financial system has been the status quo. Of course, there have been technological advancements, but the concept of using a centralized bank hasn't been challenged for all of recorded history. When most children are taught about finances for the first time, they are told that you keep your money in a bank. These institutions have become ingrained as key parts of most societies.</p>
  <p>It can be argued that the idea of centralized finance is so ingrained in our society because we went for so long without a viable alternative. Until 2009, when the technological structure of a decentralized network was created, we simply didn't have any other option than to use banks, even though they might not always have our best interest in mind (see 2008).</p>
  <p>Historically, a bank was always needed to determine who has what funds. There was no way to track transactions in a transparent manner. Now that decentralized technology can do just that, a robust financial system is being created that is an alternative to banks. For the first time, there is another option for the average user, one that does not have to rely on these large centralized banks.</p>
  <p>Now that this decentralized alternative exists, it is a matter of creating awareness that there is an alternative path. In order for this to occur, the DeFi ecosystem has to develop and offer more freedom and functionality to users than they would get from a bank. For the first time in history, these financial services can be carried out without a bank.</p>
