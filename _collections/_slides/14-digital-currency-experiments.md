    <p class="subtitle">There were several mostly centralized digital currency projects that lent their innovations to Bitcoin.</p>
    <p>There were several digital currency projects that preceded the creation of Bitcoin. These projects ultimately failed, but several technical parts were adopted by Satoshi Nakamoto in order to make up the Bitcoin network.</p>
    <p>In 1989, David Chaum created a form of centralized &#x201C;electronic money&#x201D; that utilized the same kinds of cryptographic protocols (like public/private key cryptography) that support modern cryptocurrency networks, like Bitcoin.</p>
    <p>All of these projects were released in the 20 years that preceded Bitcoin&apos;s creation, and all had innovative components that would ultimately be included in the Bitcoin protocol.</p>
    <p>The problem with these early digital currency projects was that they could not sufficiently put all of these innovations together, it was Bitcoin that did that. Many of these organizations also had another thing in common. They had a level of centrality where the government could shut them down. </p>
