  <p class="subtitle">Like savings, lending is a great way to leverage your cryptocurrency into more crypto! Savings provides modest returns with little risk. Loans can default, but provide a higher return.

  <p>DeFi is all about eliminating the role of the banks as financial gatekeepers. Part of that includes the bypassing of the restrictions and lack of infrastructure that have previously kept people from providing loans. Outside of investing, the only viable way to grow your money was through minuscule interest rates. The banks turned around and would loan out this money at much higher rate. DeFi offers both lenders and those taking out a loan better terms by cutting out the third party in the transaction. Using liquidity pools or direct peer-to-peer loans, capital providers can get a better return than through traditional savings accounts. Those seeking loans are able to receive a better interest rate than those offered by the banks.</p>
  <p>Through the power of smart contracts, funds can be locked up and only released upon repayment of a loan. Compound Finance is an example of a decentralized finance app that allows users to loan and borrow cryptocurrency without the use of a centralized service. That means no bank. Instead, the rules are ingrained in the open protocol.  Instead of matching up lenders and borrowers for peer-to-peer loans, Compound Finance instead utilizes smart contract-based liquidity pools in order to maximize efficiency. Matching up individual users and amounts for loans takes a lot of time. Liquidity pools act as a middleman, but they are simply smart contracts supported by no central organization. That means less exorbitant interest rates and a higher rate of return than a simple savings account. You're essentially making your cryptocurrency available to be loaned out by putting money in your savings account. Why not lock up those funds in a liquidity pool and earn a higher rate of return? More and more users are asking themselves this question. If this trend continues, we can expect to see the DeFi user base grow.</p>
