    <p class="subtitle">A self-sovereign identity backed by blockchain technolgy can give us greater control over our personal data .</p>
    <p>Identity theft is a horrible thing to go through. Why does it seem to happen so much?</p>
    <p>You give your personal data over to organizations that aren&apos;t good at preserving privacy. This is the exact opposite of what a self-sovereign identity can achieve. A self-sovereign identity gives you control over your personal data and who is allowed to view that data. Data transmission on an as needed basis</p>
    <h4 id="h.qoi8kdv7zj87">Example</h4>
    <p>When you try to buy alcohol, you need to hand over your entire ID and have it scanned in order to make that purchase. You have to hand over your driver&apos;s license number, address, donor status when the only thing that has to be confirmed is your age. You&apos;re pushing all that information into the hands of a third party where it can later be compromised. With decentralized identity management solutions, only the information needed to transact is sent to be confirmed. Instead of handing over a document with all of your personal information, you&apos;re simply using the necessary parts of your established, encrypted identity in order to hand over just the information that is required. The less that your important personal data is used in a transaction, the less likely you are to have your identity become compromised. This is a big step to ensuring our digital privacy and gives us greater ownership of our identities.</p>
