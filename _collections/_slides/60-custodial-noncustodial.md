notes: | 
    <p class="subtitle">If you do not have sole control over your private key, you are at risk of losing your cryptocurrency.</p>
    <p>When it comes to managing private keys, there are two types of wallets. Custodial wallets manage your private keys for you, while non-custodial wallets provide you with this information. The person who controls your private keys controls your cryptocurrency, so we recommend that you use a non-custodial wallet and manage your own private keys. This comes with a trade-off. Since this gives you sole control of your cryptocurrency, there is no way to undo a mistaken transaction, or to restore a wallet if the keys are lost. </p>
