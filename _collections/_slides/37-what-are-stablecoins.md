  <li>Establish that stablecoins hold a specific price (usually USD)</li>
  <li>Easy access to stablecoins limits the volatility of crypto, making lots of financial instruments able to use a cryptocurrency element</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that have their total supply and price pegged to a corresponding value, whether backed by fiat or assets. While they are classified as cryptocurrencies, stablecoins are more accurately described as an asset with a set price. </p>

  <h4>Goals of Stablecoins:</h4>
    
  <h5>Limits volatility</h5>
  
  <p>Weâ€™ve mentioned the problems with holding and exchanging volatile assets. Stablecoins offer a consistent price which provides the peace of mind and security that may propel new investors into the cryptocurrency market. Additionally, stablecoins might gain users from economies experiencing currency volatility.  </p>
    
  <h5>Acts as an onboarding tool to get more people into the cryptocurrency markets</h5>
    
  <p>Buying cryptocurrency is much easier to do with an onboarding step. It is difficult to directly buy cryptocurrencies with fiat, so stablecoins act as a bridge to make this process more efficient. Instead of trying to buy cryptocurrency directly with fiat currency, it is much easier to buy stablecoins with fiat currency, then convert those stablecoins into other cryptocurrencies. </p>
    
  <h5>Faster settlement times</h5>
      
  <p>Sending money across borders traditionally is expensive and slow. You might have to wait a week for a cross-border money transfer to be finalized. Cryptocurrency has proven to be an efficient and relatively inexpensive way of transferring money around the world. Stablecoins offer the ability to transfer value quickly without having to worry about the possibility of a rapid decline in price.</p>
