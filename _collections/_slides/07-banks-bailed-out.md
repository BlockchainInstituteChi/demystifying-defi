  <p class="subtitle">The aftermath of the global financial crisis started with questions surrounding the fate of these insoluble banks. Should the government bail out the banks through a huge stimulus package or let them fail? To avoid more possible damage, the government ended up bailing out the banks.</p>
  <p>Or should they let the banks default and go into bankruptcy proceedings? Each potential "solution" came with its own drawbacks. Bailing out the banks would keep an inherently flawed financial system intact. Additionally, the concept of moral hazard was an issue. Would the banks really learn their lesson if they were summarily rescued without being punished for their negligence? Critics said banks would likely not change their behavior and a repeat of the global financial crisis could occur without major reformation.</p>
  <p>The other option would have been more drastic and had the potential for even greater disruption. Letting the insoluble banks default would likely lead to even more savings being wiped out. This would, however, reduce the existing financial system to rubble. Burning it all down would have consequences, but at least we would have the opportunity to build a more fair financial system.</p>
