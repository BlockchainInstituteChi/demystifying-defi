  <p class="subtitle">Banking services are limited by geography. Some banks have decided that their profit model does not include expanding their services to those who cannot get a savings account or access simple financial services. Our existing system has left these people behind with little hope for economic growth. DeFi allows anybody to be the bank. This opens an opportunity for individuals wanting to offer services traditionally offered by a bank.</p>

  <p>Banking services are limited by geography. Some banks have decided that their profit model does not include expanding their services to those who cannot get a savings account or access simple financial services. Our existing system has left these people behind with little hope for economic growth. DeFi allows anybody to be the bank. This opens an opportunity for individuals wanting to offer services traditionally offered by a bank </p>
    
  <p>There is no denying that some have been left out of the existing financial system. As of 2017 (according to the World Bank), 1.7 billion people do not have access to banking services. IBM breaks down the number of unbanked by location as follows, "The most deprived areas include 80 percent of sub-Saharan Africa, 67 percent of adults in the Middle East, 65 percent of Latin America, and over 870 million individuals across East and Southeastern Asia." The problem is widespread and exacerbated by many other obstacles, yet cryptocurrency is becoming an option for these people for the first time. Part of this was the development of the DeFi ecosystem. Before the advent of reliable stablecoins, it wasn't feasible for these individuals to maintain their savings in such a volatile asset.  </p>
    
  <p>Stablecoins are just one aspect of DeFi that can help the unbanked. From savings to lending, both of which we'll visit later in the course, financial services beyond simple banking are being offered. A global financial marketplace is taking shape. It is one that transcends borders, allowing use by everyone.</p>
