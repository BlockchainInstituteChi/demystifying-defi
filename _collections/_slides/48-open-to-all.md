  <p class="subtitle">Banks have acted as gatekeepers, the only ones allowed to administer certain services and products. DeFi takes control away from these central entities, allowing average crypto users the ability to "be the bank".</p>

  <p>There is no single point of failure in DeFi applications. Since there are no administrators, who decides who will be part of the network?</p>
    
  <p>The answer is no one. Blockchains are decentralized, egalitarian software that anyone can join. Simply download and run the program, download the blockchain, and you're part of the network.</p>
    
  <p>For most, this is a luxury, an added option to their existing financial system. Decentralized technology is specifically designed so that every person could participate. This makes sense considering some of Satoshi's visions concerning the average person having a say over the financial systems they participate in. Too often we have been beholden to banks that are more interested in corporate profits and staying in power than creating a financial system that is open to all.</p>
    
  <p>This openness doesn't just extend to who is allowed to use this system.
  “Open to all” also indicates an open financial system where users have full control over their financial decisions. This means that transactions cannot be censored in an open system. Compared with banks that don't have the average person's best interest in mind, an open, inclusive financial system offers more economic fairness.</p>
