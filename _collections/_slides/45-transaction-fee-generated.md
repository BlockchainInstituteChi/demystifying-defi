notes: | 
    <p class="subtitle">Miners selling off bitcoin results in more transactions being initiated. The cycle repeats.</p>
    <p>The transactions generated by miners create more opportunities for more transactions to be mined and more fees to be had. A new block is created and the cycle repeats. </p>
    <p>Once the maximum allotment of bitcoin is reached, Satoshi anticipated that transaction fees would pay for miner work after there are no more block rewards introducing new crypto into the ecosystem. </p>
