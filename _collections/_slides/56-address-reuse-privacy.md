notes: | 
    <p class="subtitle" id="h.98hef71jdgwc">Reusing addresses limits the ability to remain private.</p>
    <p>So how can you get as close to anonymous as possible, even though you can&apos;t fully get to that standard? </p>
    <p>You never reuse an address. Each transaction comes from a different address.         </p>
    <p>This might be a cumbersome annoying task, or more accurately it used to be. Individuals interested in maintaining more privacy when using bitcoin can use something called HD (hierarchical deterministic) wallets. This allows you to use a new address for every conducted transaction, all controlled by the same password.</p>
