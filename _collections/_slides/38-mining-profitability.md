notes: | 
    <p class="subtitle">Mining is often not profitable, depending on the cost of energy and the price of the cryptocurrency mined.</p>
    <p>Is mining profitable? The simple answer is sometimes. Mining comes down to two main variables that determine profit: energy consumption and cryptocurrency price. The cost of the energy used by miners is weighed against the amount expected to be received as a block reward. If the cost of the energy consumed in the mining process is less than the price that the received cryptocurrency can be sold for, it is profitable. However, if the amount needed or the cost of energy increases, or the price of cryptocurrency drops, mining might become not profitable. There are some handy sources, like <a href="http://www.coinwarz.com">www.coinwarz.com</a> that can estimate the profitability of mining. Remember, energy cost varies depending on location.</p>
