  <p class="subtitle">DeFi takes financial instruments and services traditionally offered by banks and investment institutions and puts users in control by utilizing decentralized protocols with no central administrator. Trusting third parties is removed from the equation. Only the open protocol, which is auditable, has to be trusted.</p>

  <p>DeFi takes financial instruments and services traditionally offered by banks and investment institutions and puts users in control.</p>
    
  <p>But how can we do that without the institutions that manage our money? How do we create a system where users are in control? The answer is decentralization.</p>
    
  <p>Decentralized protocols have no central administrator. Instead, the network is governed by a set of transparent rules, or a protocol. Trust is removed from the equation. Only the open protocol, which is able to be audited by any user, is necessary. This unprecedented transparency allows for a decentralized financial system that is fully inclusive and cannot censor any transactions, as there is no central administrator calling the shots. For the first time we are seeing truly open, inclusive financial options emerge.</p>
