    <p class="subtitle">Bitcoin was created for a to address lack of financial autonomy.</p>
    <p>To start, ask a simple question. Why even bother learning about Bitcoin, blockchains, and cryptocurrencies? </p>
    <p>The answer to this question lies in the origin of the Bitcoin network, the first blockchain.</p>
    <p>What problem was Bitcoin looking to solve that makes it unique? Why do you need Bitcoin to achieve this goal? </p>
    <p>In order to answer that question, you have to ask another question. Do you really have control over our own money? Do you have the ability to transact with those you want without any chance of censorship from banks, payment processors, or government entities?</p>
