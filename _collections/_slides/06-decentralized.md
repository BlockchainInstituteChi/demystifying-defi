  <p class="subtitle">DeFi relies on decentralized networks:
    <ul>
      <li>Lack of a central administrator </li>
      <li>Governance by protocol</li>
      <li>Establishing scalable trust</li>
    </ul></p>
  <p class="subtitle">Like Bitcoin, DeFi is a response to an overregulated financial system filled with moral hazard.</p>
  <p>The rise of DeFi is a direct response to the overly centralized nature of our current financial systems. Access is restricted and decisions about the financial wellbeing of the average person are made by a few select individuals or groups in positions of power. This is not the first response to this problem, but rather the next step in the movement towards decentralization. That first response? The creation of Bitcoin, the first blockchain.</p>
  <p>To provide the proper context of the creation of Bitcoin, we must examine the major world events occurring at the time of its creation. 2008 is a year that stands out for some very bad reasons. The world's largest economy, the US, had a series of reckless investments backfire on the centralized banks and investment institutions that made them. Reckless investing and lack of transparency and oversight triggered a domino effect and banks started to become insoluble. These decisions, fueled by greed, had greatly impacted everyday individuals. The middle class, which had much of their savings invested in the stock markets, were the ones that were impacted the most. These people lost their retirement funds, their life savings, because they were led to believe that their investments were not risky. The same banks and brokers that thought these investments to be safe got lured into a false sense of security that led them to believe that they could get away with even more reckless investments.</p>
