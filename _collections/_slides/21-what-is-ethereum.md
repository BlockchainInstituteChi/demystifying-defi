  <p class="subtitle">Continue to tell Ethereum's origin story.</p>
  <p>In 2013, a cryptocurrency researcher named Vitalik Buterin wrote a whitepaper proposing a wider conceptual version of the blockchain concept. Buterin labeled his concept as ethereum and suggested that it would provide greater utility by allowing block data to include executable code which peers could run for each other in a complete computing environment. A cryptocurrency known as ether would help support the network by providing economic incentive.</p>
  <p>Rather than the blockchain existing as a ledger of transactions, Buterin proposed that the chain might instead serve as a source of communal truth for the results of computations. Instead of value being transferred in the form of coded data, why couldn't data be processed in a decentralized network with many equal participants? In order for this to happen, ethereum would have to add a component that could effectively process this data, a functionality that was limited in bitcoin because of how much data can be processed.</p>
  <p>In this new version, the network of peers collectively would send data to be processed in the form of transactions, while a communal ledger recorded these transitions. The rules of this transition and functionality are encompassed in the consensus rules, which you may want to explore on Github. Collectively, the group of peers are referred to as the ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).</p>
