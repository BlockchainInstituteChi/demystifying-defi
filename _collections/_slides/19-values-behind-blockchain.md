    <p class="subtitle">Satoshi Nakamoto&apos;s motivation behind the creation of Bitcoin can be deduced from his forum posts.</p>
    <p>From Satoshi&apos;s writings and the design of the bitcoin network, we can deduce that certain values motivated Satoshi&apos;s innovation. The first is anti-censorship. The immutable nature of a blockchain lets users add whatever valid data they want to the chain without the possibility of their transaction being censored by a third party. Basically, Bitcoin offers freedom to transact data without the need of a third party.</p>
    <p>The information is transmitted to the public, creating both transparency and accountability. Everyone has an updated ledger of who has what, the idea being that it is much harder to commit fraudulent activities when everything is in the light of day and can be easily verified by other members of the network. Since there is an immutable chain of blocks being stacked one after another, the data within the blockchain cannot be changed, it can only be appended through another transaction.</p>
    <p>Satoshi eliminated trusting another when you&apos;re transacting with them. No trust has to be placed in unpredictable people that you don&apos;t know and are likely looking to make a buck off of you. Only the self governing, transparent software has to be trusted.</p>
