    <p class="subtitle">Centralized servers compromise users&apos; personal data security. Decentralized networks are made up of egalitarian members that distribute data accross the network.</p>
    <p>The problem with many of these projects was that they were vulnerable to attacks. Every single transaction went through a central server. This client-server model extends to how we interact with each other today. If you&apos;re sending a Facebook message to your friend, you&apos;re not sending that message directly to your friend. No, that message has to be facilitated and transmitted by facebook&apos;s servers.</p>
    <p>The problem with this model is that the information we send that goes through that server doesn&apos;t stay private. These servers often log your personal data for their own profit driven purposes. These servers that are really there to facilitate transactions of data also have the side effect of being central repositories for your data. Data people are willing to spend money to obtain. This can include your credit card and social security numbers.</p>
    <p>This isn&apos;t just a theory. It&apos;s already happening. There are too many hacks to mention all of them, but the Equifax hack alone exposed the data of 143 million Americans. Including social security numbers. That&apos;s something like 40% of Americans that now have to worry about identity theft. That percentage becomes even higher when you consider that most people under 18 don&apos;t have credit profiles. </p>
    <p>So these projects that had central servers that act as data repositories are bad news for your personal data. So is there a way to bypass this central server? For you to directly send data to another user on the network? This centralized system is what bitcoin was built to replace.</p>
    <h4>Introducing Decentralized Networks</h4>
    <p>The architecture and purpose of decentralized networks are completely different than their centralized counterparts. The network construction is similar to those of popular peer-to-peer file sharing software that was used to download music in the &#x2018;90s to the early part of the next decade. One of the first was Napster, however, Napster had some centralized aspects to it, mainly on the front-end in its search function. This is one of the reasons that Napster was shut down.</p>
    <p>The next iterations of Napsters, like Kazaa and Limewire, were fully peer to peer networks that were not governed by a central server. As a result, this network had a lot more staying power because there wasn&apos;t a central server to shut down.</p>
    <p>If computers are directly sending data between them (in this case sharing music files), there is no use for a central server to process (and collect) information. The processing duties that were filled by the central server are shared among the users of the network. Essentially, an egalitarian network of computers helps with governing the network. We&apos;ll get into that process in our next section.</p>
