  <p class="subtitle">Ethereum ended up solving the Lighthouse crowdfunding problem by confirming blocks at a much faster rate, making it conducive to accepting the volume of funds contributed.</p>
  <p>This occurred around the time that Ethereum would be launched. The next few years saw massive growth for the platform, and one of the areas that it had excelled in happened to be in crowdfunding. This crowdfunding model eventually would turn into a way for new projects to initially distribute their tokens through a crowdsale. This process was known as an "Initial Coin Offering", a play on the concept of an IPO. With so many tokens being created, there were often several ICOs on a single day. Ethereum's block structure and quick confirmation time made Mike Hearn's original goals a reality.</p>
  
  <p>2017 saw over $1.5B raised via Ethereum-based ICOs, causing massive growth in the platform's popularity. This alternative fundraising method allowed projects to skip the traditional venture capital route, instead valuing a decentralized funding model where they would sell their new token. These events coincided with a time that saw a lot of dApp growth on the Ethereum network.</p>
