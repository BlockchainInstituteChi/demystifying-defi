title: Understanding Mining
slideId: block-example
type: example
goal: "The purpose of this activity is to show how decentralized networks made up of competing miners reach network consensus."

    <h3 class="exampleSubhead">Description</h3>
    <span class="handsOnParagraph">In this scenario, we are going to slow down the mining race between two miners. Each miner has a copy of Charlie’s transaction for the block they are going to compile. Whichever miner that wins the race has included Charlie’s transaction in the block they are creating. No matter which miner wins, Charlie’s transaction gets included in the blockchain. The transactions compiled by non-winning miners are sent back to the mempool until they are added into a block by another miner.</span>
    <h3 class="exampleSubhead">Discussion Points</h3>
    <ul class="exampleBullets">
      <li>Who determines which transactions get added to the block?</li>
      <li>What happens if my transaction does not get mined?</li>
      <li>What happens to Charlie's transaction if it is not immediately included in a block?</li>
    </ul>

Now let’s set up a scenario where Alice (Miner 1) has Charlie’s transaction in the block they are trying to create, while Bob (Miner 2) has not included Charlie’s transaction into the block they are racing to create. What happens to Charlie’s transaction? It depends on which miner’s computer solves a difficult math problem. If Alice wins the race, then Charlie’s transaction will be included in the next block. If Bob wins the race, Charlie’s transaction is not added to the chain as Bob did not include it in his block. 

<b>Required materials</b> (what you need to do the activity): 

A set of lego-like building blocks:
4 Four Brick Segments (Long blue blocks) 
Represents existing blocks, stacked together to represent the blockchain
- 6 single blocks (Blue)
Represents transactions waiting to be mined
2 single blocks (Red)
Represents the specific transactions used in the example
2 signs used to label competing miners 
Alice and Bob

<b>Setup:</b>
Stack the 4 large blue blocks

Stack the four long blocks in the 
Place four single blocks behind each miner’s sign
Three single blue blocks, the fourth being a single red block.
