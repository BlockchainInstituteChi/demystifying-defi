    <p class="subtitle">Define immutability and learn the structure of blockchains. Temporary forks occur when multiple blocks are found near the same time. </p>
    <p>Once the miner wins the race and compiles a valid block, the block joins the end of the chain! Permanently. The construction of a blockchain is what makes it unique. Blocks are added in chronological order. Since data cannot be changed on the blockchain, a property known as immutability, it provides a great historical record of public transactions. </p>
    <p>Once the block is added to the chain, it is considered to have one confirmation, since nodes have validated all transactions in a block. Each successive block counts as another confirmation since it solidifies the block&apos;s position into the chain. Blockchains are immutable, so it is impossible to remove a block. Each successive block would have to be undone, one at a time, in order to get to a block solidified in the middle of a chain.</p>
    <p>The more blocks that are stacked on top of our specific block, the more you can be assured that this transaction will become part of the permanent blockchain. Each block counts as an additional confirmation, and these confirmations have practical uses.</p>
    <p>If you&apos;re selling a cup of coffee, you might be alright with waiting for just one confirmation, when that block is added to the chain. If you&apos;re selling a house or something more valuable, you might want to wait for 6 confirmations.</p>
    <p>Why wait for confirmations if the block has already been added to the chain? Well there&apos;s the slight possibility of the blockchain temporarily forking, trying to add two blocks at once. Eventually during the next few blocks, one chain will be built upon and the other will be sent back to a &quot;waiting room&quot; along with the transactions in the block formed by the miner who does not win the race. This is a rare occurrence, but definitely shows it&apos;s a good idea to wait for 6 confirmations when transacting with large values. Once a transaction has 6 confirmations, or 5 blocks after it, there&apos;s an astronomically high chance that the block is part of the correct chain.</p>
