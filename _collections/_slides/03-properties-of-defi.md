    <p class="subtitle">Describe the overarching values of the DeFi ecosystem</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Open</li>
        <li>Modular</li>
        <li>Decentralized</li>
        <li>Independent</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are several values that motivated the creation of a more inclusive financial system where the user had more control. Openness ensures a more fair, transparent financial system. The modularity of the applications around decentralized finance allows for developers to create completely unique tools from new innovations that come up. Developers can choose from a variety of functions and create models as if they were building with Legos. The decentralized nature of this new financial system addresses the overly centralized current system that has led to a few select individuals making decisions on behalf of the average individual. The problem is these decisions have not always been in the best interest of the average consumer/investor/saver.</p>
    <p>Decentralized finance, for the first time, allows the average person to serve the function of the bank.</p>
