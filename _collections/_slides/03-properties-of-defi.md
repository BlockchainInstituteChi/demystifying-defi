    <p class="subtitle">Describe the overarching values of the DeFi ecosystem</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Open</li>
        <li>Modular</li>
        <li>Decentralized</li>
        <li>Independent</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are several values that motivated the creation of a more inclusive financial system where the user has more control. Openness ensures a more fair, transparent financial system. The modularity of the applications around decentralized finance allows for developers to create completely unique tools by combining new innovations. Developers can choose from a variety of functions and create models as if they were building with Legos; mixing and matching whatever tools or components to create something new. The decentralized nature of this new financial system addresses the centralized banking system that has led to a few select individuals making decisions on behalf of the average person. The problem is these decisions have not always been in the best interest of the average consumer/investor/saver.</p>
    <p>Decentralized finance, for the first time, allows the average person to serve the function of the bank.</p>
