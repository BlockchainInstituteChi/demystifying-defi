    <p class="subtitle">Mining difficulty is adjustmented to maintain consistent block production. Block reward halving is used to control inflation by slowly issuing bitcoin.</p>
    <p>There are a couple of variables in the protocol that are adjusted to keep the network running as designed. These are ingrained into the rules of the Bitcoin software. The first is what is known as a difficulty adjustment, and this refers to how hard miners have to work in order to solve that equation for the right to win a block reward.</p>
    <p>The network aims for new blocks to be created every ten minutes, however, it is not a set rule that blocks are created every ten minutes. Since blocks are created when miners solve for a variable, the aim is for these equations to be solved every ten minutes, on average. If blocks are being found at a rate under ten minutes, these equations are made harder so it will take miners closer to ten minutes to solve a block. If blocks aren&apos;t being found fast enough, the difficulty of the equation is reduced. The mining difficulty is adjusted every 2048 blocks, or roughly every two weeks.</p>
    <p>The second protocol change that is coded into the Bitcoin software is the adjustment to the block reward. Every 210,000 blocks, or roughly four years, the block reward halves. The original block reward was 50 BTC, and has since halved twice, currently sitting at 6.25 BTC. This reward is set to halve again later this year. Reducing the block reward over time helps to control inflation.</p>
