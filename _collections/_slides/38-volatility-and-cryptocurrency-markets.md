  <h4>Volatility and Markets</h4>
  
  <p>Volatility is defined as the range of price that an asset concurrency could potentially reach, whether positive or negative. In other words, it is the variation of price over a duration of time. It’s nearly impossible for a market to maintain the price of an asset, with the price varying on a day-to-day basis, sometimes by the microsecond due to automated high-frequency trading. Some assets and currencies have proven to be more stable than others. It’s important to note that volatility does not exclusively apply to downward price movements; it includes both gains and losses.</p>
    
  <p>While there have been many efforts to limit the volatility of an asset, it is impossible to completely limit swings in price, as markets are fluid. Volatility cannot be completely eliminated, but we are able to create measurements that estimate the risk or volatility of an asset or asset class. Mathematically, volatility is usually measured in standard deviation, but there are more specific measurements that have been developed. For example, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (BOE) created VIX, short for Volatility Index. This index measures the level of price volatility that can be expected in the near future.</p>

  <h4>Capitalizing off of Price Volatility</h4>
  
  <p>While price volatility can be a major issue for merchants and buyers, volatility is not necessarily a bad thing; it largely depends on your role in the market. If you want or expect your assets to slowly appreciate at a steady pace, you probably don’t like volatility. However, if you are a trader that is closely following the market in order to make a profit, volatility can mean opportunity. It is a lot easier to turn a profit in a timely manner by buying and selling an asset that is likely to have a bigger price increase in a shorter amount of time. However, volatility can also burn traders, as a sharp price decrease could derail any plans to turn a profit. No matter your role in the ecosystem, price volatility greatly affects how markets perform in a given duration of time.</p>
    
  <p>Too much volatility is a bad thing even for traders, as it can result in steep price decreases and loss of value. A stock market decline of 10% is considered a “correction” and can be a catalyst to holders dumping their stock. For cryptocurrency, a 10% swing within a day is routine. Volatility existed well before cryptocurrency, but it is specifically evident within those markets. While the young age of cryptocurrency contributes to this, there are numerous other factors that influence the price of traditional cryptocurrencies. Smaller markets and the young age of cryptocurrencies creates a substantial amount of volatility within the cryptocurrency markets.</p>
