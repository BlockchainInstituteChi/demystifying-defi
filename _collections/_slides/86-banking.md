    <p class="subtitle">Decentralized digital uniqueness is already impacting operations in the financial technology sector.</p>
    <p>Decentralized digital uniqueness brings about two things that can impact banking. The first is that it can provide the ability to know which account has what amount of money at any given time (unit of account). This ability leads us to the next thing that decentralized digital uniqueness then provides, complete control over your own money. </p>
    <p>Think about it, we&apos;ve relied on banks to be the centralized holder and processor of many payments, and this has led to certain barriers when it comes to using our own money. These banks sometimes act as gatekeepers, keeping you from your own funds. </p>
    <p>The bottom line is that you had to rely on banks in order to store and transfer our own money. A decentralized network made up of digitally unique participants completely undermines the status quo of centralized banks. A network that can come to a consensus has proven to be a viable means of transaction, Bitcoin proved that. There is no reason these principles can&apos;t extend to the banking and financial services industry as a whole.</p>
    <p>This is already happening with the onset of something called Decentralized Finance. Instead of ignoring this technology, banks are asking how they can adapt blockchain technology to fit their needs. We already talked about how long it takes to conduct a simple wire transfer compared to a cryptocurrency transaction. Banks have noticed and asked how they can use the technology for interbank settlement. It&apos;s currently relatively quick to make a transaction using bitcoin compared to a wire transfer, now banks are using blockchain technology in order to address this issue.</p>
