  <p class="subtitle">Open-source software is the norm for DeFi applications. There is a certain value of collaboration that has been established, allowing developers to pick and choose what innovations they want to incorporate or iterate upon.</p>
  <p>Additionally, there is a security component to open-source software. If everyone can view and audit the code, users can be assured of smart contract security when using a dApp. Many projects actually offer bounties for the public to find bugs in their software. However, the transparent nature of these applications does also pose a security risk if there are attack vectors left unaddressed. Hackers can see what is going on under the hood of the dApp, allowing them to focus on and attack what they perceive to be a weak point.</p>
  <p>Despite the vulnerabilities, most DeFi dApps have avoided major issues. Open-source software can help improve security if proper measures are taken. There are also some other interesting security measures at play involving the relationship between cryptocurrency and finance.</p>
