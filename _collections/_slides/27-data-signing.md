    <p class="subtitle">In order to initiate a transaction, it must be signed by use of a private password.</p>
    <p>The first step in a transaction is initiating it. Through a secure process known as data signing, a user can prove ownership of funds, then send those funds to a desired recipient. </p>
    <p>The transferer utilizes their cryptographic password in order to sign-off on the transaction, sending it to a specified member of the network. The transaction cannot start without this process. Since a cryptographically derived password, or private key, is signing the message, you can be assured that the true holder of the cryptocurrency is actually sending the transaction. </p>
