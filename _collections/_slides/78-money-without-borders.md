    <p class="subtitle">Cryptocurrency is accepted on a global scale. It is a currency that transcends borders.</p>
    <p>One of the most annoying parts of traveling out of the country is having to exchange currency when arriving at your destination. Airport currency exchanges use their convenient placement to charge exorbitant fees.</p>
    <p>Bitcoin is a borderless global currency, so no conversion is needed when traveling. There are many examples of content creators using only cryptocurrency to travel internationally. Surprisingly, most are able to easily accomplish this by finding a few merchants willing to accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrency.</p>
