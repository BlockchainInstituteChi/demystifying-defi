notes :
  <p class="videoNotes">MetaMask is one of these dApps that connect a wallet to the decentralized web, but it works in concert with dApps instead of acting as a browser. MetaMask allows you to be able to use your traditional browser to use the wallet capabilities needed for browsing and using dApps. Of course, phishing is a potential issue. Always make sure you are visiting the actual page you're intending to. Even the most careful of us might accidentally go to the wrong URL. Luckily, MetaMask affords an extra layer of security by automatically alerting you of potential phishing attacks.</p>
  <p class="subtitle">Connecting hardware wallet</p>
  <p>A newer feature that has been rolled out by MetaMask has been to increase interoperability between the extension and popular hardware wallets. Both Trezor and Ledger wallets are now compatible with Metamask, which is a significant improvement upon the limited ways to spend using a hardware wallet. MetaMask is all about interoperability and is a big part of the decentralized web. As a result, it can work with a large number of dApps. The same cannot be said for these hardware wallets; many hardware wallets cannot easily connect with dApps. MetaMask acts as a bridge between your hardware wallet and the decentralized web.</p>
