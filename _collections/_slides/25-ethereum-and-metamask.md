notes : 
  <p>Metamask is one of these dApps that connect a wallet to the decentralized web, but it works in concert with dApps instead of acting as a browser. Metamask allows you to be able to use your traditional browser to use the wallet capabilities needed for browsing and using dApps. Of course, phishing is a potential issue. Always make sure you are visiting the actual page you're intending to. Even the most careful of us might accidentally go to the wrong URL. Luckily, Metamask affords an extra layer of security by automatically alerting you of potential phishing attacks.</p>
