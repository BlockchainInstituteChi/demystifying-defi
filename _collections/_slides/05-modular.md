  <p class="subtitle">DeFi is modular, as creators can use different parts of different innovations to create something completely new. Use "building blocks" as an example to show how customizable dApps can be. Note that all dApps are open-source, so the code can be audited or adapted by anyone. This property of DeFi encompasses the value of transparency, a key part of blockchain technology.</p>
  <p>One of the most developer-friendly aspects of decentralized finance is that most innovations can be incorporated into new creations. Developers can pick and choose previously created tools (or even aspects of these tools) to create something completely new, with a different or more successful use. For example, dApps like Metamask combine the ability to browse the decentralized web while also working as a cryptocurrency wallet.</p>
  <p>This modularity allows the DeFi ecosystem to be a playground for developers. Let's say a new innovation is a single lego block. It can be combined with other blocks to make a new tool. All applications are open-source and can be audited, so users can be sure that they are incorporating reliable code into their respective projects. This can be as simple as a new feature being integrated, improving, or combining these tools. We've referred to the modular nature of DeFi dApps as Legos. Individual digital building blocks (dapps) can be added, substituted, and reconfigured into a completely new creation.</p>
