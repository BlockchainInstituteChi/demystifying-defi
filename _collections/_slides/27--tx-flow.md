    <p class="subtitle">Explaining the blockchain transaction process, like any other abstract concept, can be difficult to do. For this reason, we've created a real-world analogy using the process of sending mail to better understand how blockchains work.<p>

    <p>The steps to a blockchain transaction can be broken down into the following stages:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Compose transaction</li>
        <li>Sign transaction</li>
        <li>Broadcast transaction to the network</li>
        <li>Validate transaction based on network rules</li>
        <li>Wait in the mempool (waiting room) for transaction to be mined</li>
        <li>Include in a block</li>
        <li>Confirmation</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Each of these steps have a corresponding step when it comes to sending a letter through the postal services.</p>

    <p>Composing a transaction includes entering in the necessary information before the transaction process can be started. Just like putting the address on a letter, basic details are required to initiate this process. These details usually include a recipient and amount to be transferred.</p>

    <p>After the cryptocurrency transaction details are provided, it is time to “seal the envelope”. This is done using a private password that ensures that you were the one to actually write the letter, just like a wax seal that makes sure an envelope has not been tampered with nor had its contents changed.</p>

    <p>Once these two steps have been completed, a crypto transaction or a letter has to be sent off. Traditionally, this is done using a stamp, which costs a small fee. With a cryptocurrency transaction, a fee is also needed to broadcast the transaction. This is used as a spam control mechanism. If there were no fees imposed by blockchains or the postal service, there would be incentive for some to send as many transactions as possible, slowing down the transaction process. This applies both digitally and to the traditional postal systems.</p>

    <p>The next step is for the transmitters to validate the transaction to make sure all of the neworks rules are being followed. This is comparable to the postal service checking to make sure that the stamp has been paid for and the package or letter being transmitted follows certain legal requirements. There are certain packages that cannot be accepted by the postal service, just like there are certain transactions that cannot be transmitted based on network rules.</p>

    <p>Once it is confirmed that a letter can be transmitted, it waits in the post office until it is sorted and taken for delivery. After a blockchain transaction is validated according to the rules of the network, it waits in a place known as the mempool. This is where validated transactions that have not been sent wait until they go through a process known as mining.</p>

    <p>When a letter is ready to be sent, it is loaded onto a vehicle and delivered. The same thing happens for a cryptocurrency, but instead of the postal service a miner competes for the right to include a transaction into the block they are creating. </p>

    <p>Once all of these steps are completed, a cryptocurrency transaction is received and confirmed on the network. The real world comparison for this action is for the recipient to open our letter. </p>
