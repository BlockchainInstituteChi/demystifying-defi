    <p class="subtitle">Fees are collected by miners. The transactions with the highest fees are most likely to be added to the next block.</p>
    <h4>So where do fees end up?</h4>
    <p>Remember when we told you that miners race to compile transactions in a block in order to receive a block reward? How do these miners pick which valid transactions to include in a block?</p>
    <p>The answer has to do with fees. Winning miners receive all the transaction fees generated in the block they compile. They receive these fees in addition to the block reward. There is a monetary incentive for miners to include transactions with the highest fees in the block they are compiling. The higher the fee, the more likely your transaction is to be included in the next block. Despite this competition, fees are usually very low on the Bitcoin network.</p>
    <p>A good real-world comparison is a theme park &#x201C;fast pass&#x201D; or a tollway, where those willing to pay provide incentive for quicker service. </p>
