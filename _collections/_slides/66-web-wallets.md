    <p class="subtitle">Some wallets can be accessed via the internet, but users should be aware of phishing attempts. </p>
    <p>Web wallets are cryptocurrency wallets that use the internet and have a web interface, allowing management of cryptocurrency via a browser. Web wallets provide a lot of convenience, but they do come with a security trade-off. When using a web wallet, it is very important to make sure you are using the correct URL. Through a process known as phishing, hackers buy up similar domains and make clones of the site that people are trying to reach. Users put their real log-in information on the cloned site, and then it is in the hands of hackers, now able to access your real account. Double checking URLs can help to avoid phishing, and there are even some browser extensions that will alert you if you&apos;re on a likely phishing site.</p>
