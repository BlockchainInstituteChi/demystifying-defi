notes: | 
    <p class="subtitle">The miner that found the valid block that is permanently added to the chain receives a block reward in the form of cryptocurrency.</p>
    <p>Once a miner creates a valid block, and there is no temporary fork, they receive newly minted Bitcoin. This is distinct from the previous step. The block reward is not immediately given to the miner, as there could be a temporary fork in the network, and two blocks cannot receive block rewards. Therefore, the block reward is locked for six confirmations, avoiding this problem.</p>
