    <p class="subtitle">Fees are used to prevent against malicious transactions from spamming the Bitcoin network.</p>
    <p>Another crucial part of Bitcoin transactions are the fees.</p>
    <p>Fees usually are annoying and generally viewed as bad things, however, fees on the bitcoin network have a purpose. The network can only process so many transactions per second. Now if there are no fees, the network can just get spammed. If someone wanted to they could send a bunch of transactions back and forth between themselves, stalling the system. Fees make this malicious action cost something. If someone wants to clog the network with spam transactions</p>
    <p>Fees are a spam prevention mechanism. In times of high network traffic, a higher fee will most likely be required in order to get your transaction mined. Think of this as an Uber surcharge, the more demand, the more price goes up.</p>
    <p>Eventually, all of the bitcoin will be minted. After block production rewards end, fees will cover the costs of running the network.</p>
