    <p class="subtitle">The transparency provided by blockchain technology can give donors more assurance that their funds will go to worthy projects.</p>
    <p>We&apos;ve examined how digital uniqueness comes into play for different use cases. Digitally unique records can include records of receiving and spending. The purpose of donating to these non-profit entities is to send money to a worthy cause in order to address a problem, but many non-profits end up spending varying amounts of that money on overhead as opposed to directly impacting the desired cause.</p>
    <p>If you donate to an organization, often you don&apos;t know how funds are spent. Blockchains create a digital record of where that money is donated, and where it is ultimately moved and spent. Charities can provide transparency by selectively moving their funds to designated wallets that can be &#x201C;earmarked&#x201D; for specific products. Since public blockchains are transparent, the wallets spending would be open to scrutiny. The transparency of a decentralized network can greatly limit fraud and misuse of funds.</p>
