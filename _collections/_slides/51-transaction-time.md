    <p class="subtitle">Other blockchains achieved lower transaction times by confirming more blocks.</p>
    <p>We already talked about how miners race to finish solving an equation in a certain amount of time. For the Bitcoin network, it usually takes about 10 minutes to solve this equation and write the next block. The period of time it takes to create one block is known as the chain&apos;s &#x201C;block time&#x201D;. The block time isn&apos;t necessarily a set duration, but rather the average amount of time it takes to solve that really tough math problem. The goal when creating this math problem is to have it ideally take as close to ten minutes as possible to solve. If this is not occuring, the difficulty of these math problems go up or down, depending on if the problem is being solved faster or slower than ten minutes on average.</p>
    <p>Bitcoin&apos;s block time is ten minutes, so a new batch of transactions is compiled by miners into a block every 10 minutes. This ten minute figure is particularly interesting considering a normal wire transfer takes at least 3 days to complete, often more depending on how fast the respective banks process the transaction. So bitcoin cut money transmission from a 3-5 day waiting period to a 10 minute waiting period.</p>
    <p>Bitcoin introduced this 10 minute block time, but other blockchains have innovated in order to cut down block times to under a minute.</p>

        <li>Bitcoin introduced 10 minute block times, a huge improvement from 3 day bank transfers</li>
        <li>Blockchain innovation has pushed block times down to seconds</li>
