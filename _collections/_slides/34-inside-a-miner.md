    <p class="subtitle">Mining devices are hardware that any user can purchase in order to contribute to the network.</p>
    <p>Miners are computers with strong processing units that race to solve equations that allow the node to compile blocks and receive the corresponding block reward. Miners have several components, but the most important is the cooling units. Mining is very energy intensive and generates a fair amount of heat, so fans are used to keep the miner from overheating.</p>
    <p>Mining projects have arisen in cold climates, like northern Europe, where open-air facilities that allow the natural cold temperatures to regulate the heat generated by the miners.</p>
    <p>All of these parts can be purchased by anyone who wants to build one. Nothing is special or privileged, and everything is entirely accessible and open source. The price tag of a machine like this is quite low, so anyone who wants to participate can buy their own machine and flash it with whatever mining software they want (which can be downloaded for free online).</p>
