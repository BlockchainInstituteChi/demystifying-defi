  <p class="subtitle">Basic Attention Token (BAT) was introduced as a way for publishers and advertisers to reward users who interact with their ad content. This was an interesting development, as BAT represented an abstract concept, representing and rewarding attention with cryptocurrency. BAT is used in concert with the Brave Browser.</p>
  <p>One of the earlier, innovative cryptocurrencies based on ethereum was the Basic Attention Token (BAT). This project dedicated itself to addressing the publisher/advertiser/viewer relationship. While the current system abuses personal data and doesnâ€™t reward users for paying attention to ads, BAT flipped this concept on its head.</p>
  <p>Instead of advertisers throwing an ad at you and hoping that you would watch it, the project introduced interactive ads that could prove that attention has been paid to that ad. As a result, BAT can be paid to users who interact with ads. An additional feature gives users the ability to reward their favorite content creators with their own BAT.</p>
