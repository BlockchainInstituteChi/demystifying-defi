    <p class="subtitle">There were further blockchain innovations after the introduction of Bitcoin, resulting in new blockchains.</p>
    <p>While Bitcoin was the first use of blockchain technology, it certainly was not the last. Many projects iterated on the path that Bitcoin paved. One of the most popular is Litecoin, which is heavily influenced by the Bitcoin protocol. They did make a couple of related changes. Litecoin had a block time close to 2.5 minutes, one-fourth of bitcoins. The project also had a total supply of 84 million coins, four times that of Bitcoin.</p>
    <p>Namecoin introduced the storage of DNS data to blockchain technology and Mastercoin enabled extra functionality on Bitcoin by putting extra metadata at the end of the transaction code. This led to the creation of Ethereum, which allows executable applications on the blockchain.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Litecoin</strong> Changed the original parameters of Bitcoin to be 4 times faster. <strong>Namecoin</strong> Attempted to use Bitcoin-like network to name services (similar to DNS). <strong>Mastercoin</strong> Added emergent use cases as supported transaction types. <strong>Ethereum</strong> was a Clean-sheet design to support general purpose computation</p>
