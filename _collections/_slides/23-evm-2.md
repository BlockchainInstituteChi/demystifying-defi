  <p>Because the EVM is an open system, there is a substantial risk of a rogue actor attempting to subvert the network by running code that repeats endlessly or otherwise monopolizes the computational power of the network. In order to prevent this, a pricing unit known as Gas must be paid to run computations. Gas is purchased at the time a smart contract is triggered and must be paid with ether. Because the price of Gas can vary independently from the price of ether and will increase when many parties try to purchase it simultaneously, this provides an economic disincentive that prevents spam within the network.</p>
  <p>When a computer is not limited to the execution of a particular type of computation task, we call this Turing complete. Another way of referring to this state is computational universality, because broadly speaking, all Turing complete machines are interchangeable.</p>
  <p>In a decentralized context, this means that any code submitted to the network can be computed reliably by every node. The EVM is thereby able to operate as a single computer even though it runs on separate devices all around the world.</p>
  <p>Because the ethereum Virtual Machine is Turing complete, many new features are built using smart contracts, and rarely require changes to the core ethereum protocol. In these cases, the ERC process will mainly define a standard that developers can use to increase interoperability of their code.</p>
