  <p class="subtitle">Ethereum had many different projects that would ultimately create innovations that overcame the limitations faced by Lighthouse.</p>

  <p>We already discussed crowdfunding via Ethereum's ability to conduct ICOs, but it is difficult to fully understand the scope of the madness that was going on at the time. Once the first ICOs proved to be successful, several other projects decided to jump on the trend. They were excited to find a method of fundraising that seemed so easy. </p>

  <p>The problem was that these projects either bet on themselves by holding vast amounts of their own token, or they exchanged ICO funds for other cryptocurrencies, such as ether or bitcoin. By the height of the ICO craze, there were about 2000 unique tokens on the market. Unfortunately, a lot of these projects did not reach a point of viability. The market got too big too soon and the cryptocurrency market saw massive drops in the value of cryptocurrency. However, by this time over $4.5B was raised.</p>
