notes: | 
    <p class="subtitle">The usability of blockchain technology has improved greatly, but still has to continued to improve.</p>
    <p>When it comes to the tools needed to properly utilize blockchain technology, they aren&apos;t quite user friendly enough. They are a vast improvement upon the ecosystem that existed just a few years ago, but many still find cryptocurrency management difficult. It is only logical to assume that this trend is going to continue. There are many projects looking to make using cryptocurrency and blockchain technology easier to use. With the improvement concerning ease of use over the past few years, there will no doubt be significant advancements towards a tool that is so easy to use, most of the world has the access and ability to properly utilize it.</p>
