  <p><b>Introduce smart contracts by examining Nick Szabo's conceptual innovation. The first smart contracts were built on the Bitcoin blockchain, but ultimately met technological limitations.</b></p>
  <p>That last question was explored as Bitcoin went through its early years. At this point bitcoin didn't have the high price it does today; it was trading at cents, then dollars. Despite the relative lack of value compared to today, those early days did prove one thing; that Bitcoin could work.
Rarely do people look at innovation and leave it be. There is always room for improvement, and people are constantly trying to iterate on new technology. Bitcoin was no exception.</p>
<p>The early years involved a lot of exploring of what Bitcoin could be. What if we could program and develop on a blockchain-based ecosystem. What tools would be required for this to happen?</p>
<p>The answer to this question already existed. In the late 1990s, a concept that would become known as "smart contracts" was introduced by computer scientist Nick Szabo.</p>
