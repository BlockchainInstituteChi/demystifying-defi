    <p class="subtitle">Examine a common error in order to introduce World Wide Web protocols.</p>
    <p>So we&apos;re going to go back in time, way back to the 1980s. Back then, we were forming the basic layer of our internet protocols. Ever heard of &#x201C;Error 404&#x201D;? It&apos;s a message you get when you visit a URL that doesn&apos;t exist, but it isn&apos;t the only error that is part of these protocols. </p>
