    <p class="subtitle">Ethereum aims to create a decentralized computing platform.</p>
    <p>The Ethereum blockchain is developer-friendly and is being used to build an ecosystem. Bitcoin set out to be a peer to peer digital cash system, and it has been able to serve that purpose. It gives the ability to send money around the world instantly. </p>
    <p>The stated goal of Ethereum was to become a &#x201C;decentralized world computer powered by nodes instead of central servers&#x201D;. The blockchain-based network uses innovative programming and network structure in order to allow developers to build on the blockchain.</p>
    <p>Ethereum has some significant differences compared to Bitcoin. The first is the block time. While Bitcoin confirms blocks on an average of every ten minutes, Ethereum has reduced their block time to about 12 seconds. This is much more conducive to a blockchain that depends on data transfer as opposed to simple monetary transfer. The network is largely built using innovative tools known as smart contracts.</p>
