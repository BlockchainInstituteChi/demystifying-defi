  <p><b>Ethereum's main limitation is that it cannot process many transactions, also known as the scaling problem. Currently the network is limited to about 12 transactions per second while Visa processes 1500 tx/s. This scaling issue must be addressed for DeFi dapps to grow to meet real world demand.</b></p>
  <p>Ethereum has proven to be an interesting innovation, but there are many issues the platform must overcome in order to be a robust DeFi platform for the entire world. Its main limitation is that it cannot process many transactions. ethereum is currently limited to processing just 12 transactions per second, while Visa processes 1500tx/s. In order for ethereum to meet real world demand, it has to increase the number of transactions per second that can be processed and added to the chain. This issue is known as the scaling problem and it is one of the biggest challenges that Blockchain technology has faced.</p>
