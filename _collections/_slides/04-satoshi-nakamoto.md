    <p class="subtitle">Satoshi Nakamoto had specific motivations which led to the creation of Bitcoin.</p>
    <h4>Who is Satoshi?</h4>
    <p>Satoshi Nakamoto was the pseudonym that was used by the creator, or creators, of the Bitcoin network. A pseudonym is a false name that allows its user to remain anonymous. While no one knows Satoshi Nakamoto&apos;s true identity, there is some information that allows us some insight into his motivations in creating the Bitcoin network, the first instance of blockchain technology.</p>
    <p>Satoshi routinely wrote on Bitcoin-focused forums, where he laid out his desire for peer-to-peer digital cash. These beliefs were summarized in the Bitcoin whitepaper, the document that introduced both Bitcoin and the concept of a blockchain.</p>
    <p>Since we have these posts and writings from Satoshi, we can infer a few things about his beliefs and motivations that led to him creating what would become cryptocurrency.</p>
