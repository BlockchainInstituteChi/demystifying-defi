notes: | 
    <p class="subtitle">Most currencies are not entirely physical and are already represented digitally.</p>
    <p>Only 13% of All US Currency is physical</p>
    <p>So since our money is no longer backed by a physical asset, is it really different than digital currency? </p>
    <p>We&apos;ve already been using digital currency. Only 13 percent of all USD are represented with a physical note, the rest is just represented digitally in centralized ledgers controlled by banks. This is not endemic to the United States. Many fiat currencies are not backed by physical assets. The value has no physical representation, they are just numbers on a ledger&#x2026;.Sound familiar? </p>
