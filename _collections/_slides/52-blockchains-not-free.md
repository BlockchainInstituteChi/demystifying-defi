notes: | 
    <p class="subtitle">Fees are used to prevent network resources ffrom being wasted. They are calculated by the amount of data, or network resources, needed to execute a transaction.</p>
    <p>Interestingly enough, fees are not determined on the value of the transaction, but rather the amount of data that&apos;s being transacted. </p>
    <p>Transferring a large amount of cryptocurrency would not require much more data to be transferred than sending a smaller amount. Therefore, both of these transactions would have comparable fees. More complex operations that require a lot of data to be transferred garner higher fees.</p>
