  <p class="subtitle">Introduce decentralized exchanges and how they are different from traditional exchanges.</p>
  <p>A decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) cuts out the centralized middleman by facilitating deals via smart contracts and chain to chain swaps. The cryptocurrency is never in the possession of an escrow service; the only individuals that will have access to the cryptocurrency are the buyer and seller. Since there is no middleman, fees are lower compared to the ones incurred on centralized exchanges. The platform merely connects the participants using a decentralized peer-to-peer network, allowing them to trade directly.</p>
  <p>Decentralized exchanges are not controlled by any person or group. Because there is no central authority to hack or shut down, DEX development will likely be the focus as crypto gains  popularity. Decentralized exchanges also largely do not have any identity verification, as there is no central entity to maintain such a process. DEX platforms offer more anonymity, but the trade-off is that the platforms are often harder to use. Also, there is very little chance of a user error being reversed, since there is no central entity that can do so. Because decentralized exchanges are harder to use, they do not have the same liquidity that you find in centralized platforms. Additionally, if you lose your private key, there is no central entity to help you recover it. With these exchanges, you have sole control over your cryptocurrency but have little chance of recovering your funds if your private key is lost.</p>
  <p>There are several options when it comes to decentralized exchanges. Currently, the most popular decentralized exchange is Uniswap. Uniswap is a liquidity pool, but more specifically it is a liquidity platform, allowing users the ability to directly make trades, all without the use of a centralized order book used by other exchanges. Just like other DeFi dApps, Uniswap is not governed by people or an organization but rather by smart contracts. Users can utilize the network of smart contracts to swap most ERC-20 tokens, all without the use of a central administrator.</p>
