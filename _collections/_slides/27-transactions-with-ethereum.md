  <p>Here are the key steps to conducting a transaction on MetaMask. First, make sure you are on the Ethereum mainnet. This option can be found next to your account icon. The other networks act as sandboxes where people can test their dApps without transferring real value.</p>
  <ul><li>From the home screen select the send option</li>
  <li>Enter the receiving address</li>
  <li>Fill out the name of the cryptocurrency you want to transfer, the amount you want to send, and your gas price</li></ul>
  <p>The Ethereum Virutal Machine has limited network resources that have to be allocated properly. One way to do that is through fees, the method that the Bitcoin network uses to create a monetary disincentive for those who are looking to clog the blockchain by spamming it with transactions. Ethereum uses a fee mechanism known as gas, which functions slightly differently than Bitcoin fees, yet has the same general goal of preserving account resources. The price of gas is set based on the supply and demand of transactions, specifically finding the required gas price that the miners are collecting. This data is available publicly and can indicate times when the blockchain is busy or does not have a lot of network traffic. The goal is to find the gas price that is needed to power the EVM at that specific time. While Bitcoin fees are determined by the amount of data being transferred, gas prices are determined by the amount of effort required by the EVM in order to complete that operation. Gas is priced in ether and is the only asset that can be used to purchase gas. Basically, you need ether to utilize the network.</p>
  <p>Beyond the price of gas, there is another variable that dictates how fast your transaction will be mined. Gas limit is the maximum amount of gas you are willing to spend on one transaction. If the transaction is set to exceed the gas limit you have specified, the transaction will not go through. This is used to help users avoid accidental exorbitant gas expenditures. MetaMask will let you pick from some suggested gas prices, or you can manually enter a gas price along with a gas limit. These act as parameters for your transaction.</p>
