  <p class="subtitle">Introduce the EVM and it relates to transactions, smart contracts, and dApps</p>
  <p>The Ethereum Virtual Machine is comprised of the collective members of the network. While it is not a single entity, it uses the power of the nodes on the network to help process data. The ability to process data in a reliable and quick manner allows for developers to build applications upon this decentralized platform, appropriately named decentralized applications, or dApps.</p>
  <p>dApps function as normal applications could, but instead of relying on a central server that could fail or compromise private information, they rely on ethereum's decentralized network and the EVM in order to execute user actions. While servers are good at processing data, the inherent security risk and lack of transparency has led to the rise of an ecosystem where security and privacy are paramount. While the EVM isn't the most efficient way to process information, it does so in a decentralized manner.</p>
