    <p class="subtitle">The design of decentralized networks can be more difficult to attack than centralized servers.</p>
    <p>Take a look at how decentralized networks maintain security, and follow along with this example to understand how.</p>
    <p>Envision two neighborhoods. Why? Because you are planning a heist and you need to figure out which one to hit to make it worth your while. You need to grab at least half of the wealth from a neighborhood in order for it to be worth the risk.</p>
    <p>Neighborhood A has about 100 houses, but interestingly enough, there&apos;s one very wealthy house that happens to have 51% of the wealth. Just in that one house. Think huge safes, Picassos, the ark of the covenant, whatever.</p>
    <p>Neighborhood B has 100 houses, but each house has about the same amount of wealth. </p>
    <p>Which neighborhood do you target?</p>
    <p>Neighborhood A, since you have to hit one house to get the majority of control. Neighborhood B you would have to rob 51 of those hundred houses.</p>
    <p>How does this apply to blockchain? </p>
    <p>Well, Decentralized networks look a lot like neighborhood B, while centralized networks look like neighborhood A. That really wealthy house? That&apos;s the central server that makes all of the decisions. Grab control of that and you have control of the network. To grab control of a decentralized network, you&apos;re going to have to hijack a majority of nodes.</p>
