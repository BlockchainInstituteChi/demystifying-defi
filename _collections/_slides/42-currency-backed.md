  <p class="subtitle">Some cryptocurrencies are backed by an equal amount of currency.</p>

  <p>The simplest of stablecoins. The token is pegged to a fiat currency. For example 1 GUSD (Gemini Dollar) = 1 USD. The tokens value is represented as a digital dollar. Most stablecoins follow this pattern. 
  Fiat backs tokens on a 1:1 ratio. For every unit of currency held there is one token issued. When the token is exchanged for fiat, they are taken out of circulation. When someone wants to buy the stablecoin, their fiat is sent to the reserve and new coins are created and issued. Simply put, these stablecoins are backed by relatively stable fiat currencies. The vast majority of stablecoins either represent the USD or Euro as they are the most popular global currencies. </p>

  <h4>Tether</h4>

  <p>Tether is a cryptocurrency that is designed to mirror the value of one USD.
  1USDT=1USD. Basically, Tether is used to turn fiat into a stable, digital token. The original idea was that the company behind Tether would maintain a cash reserve equal to the number of tokens. If Tether is redeemed, those tokens are burned. Tokens are created by contributing to the Tether reserve.</p>

  <p>Over the past two years, there has been some controversy surrounding Tether, specifically their cash reserves. The root criticism is based on the fact that Tether is highly centralized. This also means that their reserves didn’t have the transparency needed to instill trust in its users. This led some to question whether Tether had the funds to back their supply. Many called for Tether to be audited. There was also concern about what would happen to the entire cryptocurrency market if it was found that Tether did not have the funds that they claimed they did.</p>

  <p>Before any type of audit could occur, the Hong Kong-based company behind Tether changed the wording on their website ever so slightly. Instead of claiming that Tether was backed 1:1 by dollars, they now claimed that their cash reserves and other assets were used to back the value of the token. This change may have scared some users away, but those using USDT as a short-term medium of exchange have not been deterred. We have, however, seen more stablecoins gain popularity as questions around Tether’s backing assets remain.</p>

  <h4>GUSD</h4>

  <p>Another popular stablecoin is known as the Gemini Dollar. This token was introduced by the team behind the Gemini Exchange, which was started by early Bitcoin enthusiasts, the Winkelvoss twins. Gemini Dollar is an Ethereum-based token that uses the Ethereum platform to function. GUSD is the first regulated stablecoin, as recognized by the New York State Department of Financial Services. This transparency is in extreme contrast to Tether. The funds that back Gemini dollars issued and in circulation are held at State Street Bank and Trust Company. Additionally, the USD balance of the relevant bank accounts is examined by a registered public accounting firm. Their reports are made public. However, this isn’t the only audit that GUSD has undergone. The code within the GUSD smart contract is public and has been publicly audited.  The approval of this regulatory body and the stringent practices employed by Gemini gives users confidence that their funds are sufficiently backed.</p>s
