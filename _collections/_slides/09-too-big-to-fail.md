    <p class="subtitle">The United States responded by bailing out the bankers, while the average citizen saw little relief.</p>
    <p>When it came to addressing the failures of major investors, there were two options: Let the banks go under, or bail them out. Our tax dollars ultimately went to rescuing the banks. However, the average citizen did not see much in terms of economic relief. People were treated as commodities. Adding insult to injury, many CEOs of these financial institutions actually received bonuses from the bailout funds. People wanted fairness and justice. The policies that followed the Global Financial Crisis did not deliver that. Additionally, the concept of moral hazard applies; that is, nothing changes if a mistake does not cause damage. If there are no negative consequences for the irresponsible risks made by the banks because a bailout is around the corner, will these practices really change?</p>
