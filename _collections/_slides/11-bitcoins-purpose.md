  <p><b>Review the invention of Bitcoin and the goals it set out to accomplish.  Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, described their creation as an electronic peer-to-peer decentralized cash system. After 12 years of Bitcoin, we can confidently say that yes, Bitcoin has definitely satisfied that goal.</b></p>
  <p>In our previous course, we were introduced to the innovation that is Bitcoin. We talked about how it allowed for peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions. There is no doubt that Bitcoin was THE trailblazer in the cryptocurrency space, but did it fulfill its stated goal?</p>
  <p>We would argue yes, and then some. Not only did Bitcoin prove itself to be a viable way to transfer value, it arguably became a much better way to send value around the world than the existing cash transfer systems. When people send money across borders, they usually do it through a bank or a money transmitter like Western Union. This process can take up to several days, and often comes with exorbitant fees. With Bitcoin it might take up to an hour (if the network is busy) and a fee of under a dollar, no matter how much bitcoin is being sent.</p>
