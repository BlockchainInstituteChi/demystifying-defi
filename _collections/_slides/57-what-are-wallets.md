    <p class="subtitle">Cryptocurrency wallets can store cryptocurrency, and can also send and receive transactions.</p>
    <p>One of the most important aspects of holding cryptocurrency is keeping it secure. So where do you keep your cryptocurrency? In a wallet, of course. Not a physical wallet, but a digital one. Cryptocurrency wallets are designed to securely &#x201C;hold&#x201D; cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency does not exist in wallets, but rather only on-chain. While the cryptocurrency is not technically stored in these wallets, they utilize a set of keys in order to allow you to securely manage your cryptocurrency. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Interface to the blockchain</li>
        <li>Doesn&apos;t actually hold your tokens</li>
        <li>It manages your keys, which authorizes coin movement with cryptographic signature</li>
        <li>Many allow for direct broadcasting and listening to the network</li>
        <li>Many can cryptographically sign and verify digital messages</li>
    </ul>
