    <p>So you know the process but do you know what is really going on with your transaction?</p>
    <p>You&apos;re not completely in the dark. There are these handy tools called block explorers which act as references to the blockchain, allowing you to see all of the goings-on of the public ledger that is the blockchain. Block explorers are a searchable interface that can reference the blockchain. By searching your address or transaction ID, you&apos;re able to find a digital receipt of your transaction. This can give you more details about your transaction, like its current status.</p>
