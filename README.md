# Blockchain Institute Crypto Curious Course Slide & Notes Generator

This repo contains the core code for generating the Crypto Curious Course slides in a variety of formats. 

# Adding Slides
To add a slide, open a template file and save it with a new name to `_collections/_slides/`. Names should start with a slide number and contain a clear description of the slide content.

# Slide Types & Templates
Each slide will be generated using a template from the _includes folder. To see the full algorithm check index.html. Template files for each slide type are also stored in the folder at `_collections/_slides/.templates/`.

## Title Break
The title slides are the simplest of all. Notes are optional, and these will be shown automatically in the Table of Contents as section headers.

## Full Image
One title, one image - it doesn't get any easier. Notes are optional but recommended.

## Full Text
Text only. Specify a blob of text to show it below the title.

## Left Right 
Text on the left, image on the right. Useful for explaining keywords or recapping earlier lessons.

## Top Bottom
Got extra-wide images? Put your text area at the top, and show an image underneath!

## Prompt Question
Just like a title slide, but with a pink background and a question mark?

## Custom
Anything goes - just enter a blob of multi-line HTML or markup text, and you can create your very own slide format for special cases like iframe'd videos or code samples! 

# Slide Attributes 
Each slide can have a range of attributes specified, which control how they are generated and how content is handled.

## Default Attributes
All slides will have the following:
```
title : String - header title
slideId : String - contains nav index
type : String (title-break, full-image, full-text, left-right, top-bottom, prompt-question, or custom)        
notes : |
    Mutli-Line 
    String
    Supports <html>
    Use spaces ( ) to indent, not tabs!
```

## Image Slides 
*NOTE:* There are three types of image slides, full-image, left-right or top-bottom.

You can specify the image to load like so:
```
img : String - name of an image file in /assets/img/
imgTitle : String - the title text for the image
imgAlt : String - the Alt text for the image
imgCaption : String - HTML Formatted string for the caption
```

### Adding Images
You will also need to make sure the image has been added to `/assets/img/`. Subfolders work fine, but make sure you include it in the `img` field.

### Example
i.e. an image at `/assets/img/crazyPhotos/dog_using_computer.png` could be shown by adding the following attributes:
```
img : "crazyPhotos/dog_using_computer.png"
imgTitle : "Dogs can blockchain too!"
imgAlt : "Dog using computer."
imgCaption : "And from that day on, WoofCoin wouldn't be just a crazy idea."
``` 

## Slides With Text
For slides that show text in the page, you'll want to use the multi-line 'bodyText' attribute as shown below.

*Note:* While full-text slides are the main use case for this, left-right and top-bottom slides also use the bodyText attribute.
```
bodyText : |
    multi-
    line
    text
```

## Slide Tags

If a slide is a discussion point, flag it so that it will be shown in the table of contents. The prompt-question slide type will automatically receive this handling.
```
isQuestionSlide : Boolean ( true or false - optional )

ex:
isSectionHead: true # this slides' title will be shown in pink in the table of contents

```

When a slide should be show in the table of contents as a section header, you can also toggle the isSectionHead tag by adding it as shown below. The title-break slide type will automatically receive this handling.
```
isSectionHead : Boolean ( true or false - optional )

ex:
isSectionHead: true # this slides' title will be shown in teal in the table of contents
```

## About
This site uses the [Jekyll templating engine](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate static HTML pages and hosts them using Github pages from the `master` branch of this repo.

Jekyll uses a combination of [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), CSS, and raw HTML to generate pages. 

***Commits made to the master branch of this repo will trigger a github pages build, which will go live after 2-3 minutes!***

# Instructions

## Local Testing
